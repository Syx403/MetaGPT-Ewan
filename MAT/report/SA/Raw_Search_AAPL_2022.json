Can Apple ever return to its glory days of high growth? These are some of the questions investors are asking lately, sparked by [reports of production cutbacks](http://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-cuts-iphone-14-plus-production-less-than-two-weeks-after-debut?) the company has made on the iPhone 14 smartphones.\n\nThese answers will be more clear when the company reports fourth quarter fiscal 2022 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday. Supply chain disruptions and rising inflation have been among the many events that have pressured the company's revenue and profits. Operating headwinds have also been compounded by uncertainty related to global growth slowdown. These factors resulted in Apple’s iPhone revenues to increase just 3% in Q3, while overall revenue rose just 2%.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple stock has held up better than the S&P 500, down just 19% year to date, compared to 23% decline for the S&P 500, suggesting the company is doing a solid job navigating the various headwinds that have impacted its business. Last week the company reportedly cut production of its iPhone 14 Plus model. According to The Information, Apple was said to be reevaluating demand for the product, of which two of its iPhone 14 Plus suppliers cut their production by 70% and 90% respectively.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether if there are any significant revenue impacts for this quarter or for the holiday quarter. But this wouldn’t be the first time Apple has adjusted production on any of its products to pair with demand. Last week, Loup Ventures analyst Gene Munster noted that lead times for iPhones are actually running higher than normal for this stage in the product cycle. As such, Munster concluded that Apple’s business \"continues to do well\" despite the macro pressures. Investors are hoping for more clarity and conviction on the bullish thesis on Thursday.\n\nIn the three months that ended September, Wall Street expect the Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant to earn $1.27 per share on revenue of $88.9 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $1.24 per share on revenue of $83.36 billion. For the full year, earnings are expected to rise 8."

The stumble raises questions about whether the company misjudged the market or simply priced the device too close to the more capable Pro models.\n\n​Despite the Air's struggles, overall iPhone sales are tracking higher year-on-year (YoY).

In addition, we launched the fantastic AirPods Pro 3 and the all-new Apple Watch lineup. When combined with the recently announced MacBook Pro and iPad Pro with the powerhouse M5 chip, we are excited to be sharing our most extraordinary lineup of products as we head into the holiday season.” \n\n“Our September quarter results capped off a record fiscal year, with revenue reaching $416 billion, as well as double-digit EPS growth,” said Kevan Parekh, Apple’s CFO. “And thanks to our very high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty, our installed base of active devices also reached a new all-time high across all product categories and geographic segments.” \n\nApple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share of the Company’s common stock.
