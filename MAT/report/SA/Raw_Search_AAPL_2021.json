Here's how Apple's Q4 2021 stacks up versus the company's previous quarters and years.\n\nThe [iPhone](https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone) maker announced its quarterly earnings on Thursday. Although it set a new overall revenue record for the September quarter, it missed Wall Street's consensus forecast for the period, largely because of supply constraints.\n\nHere's what the quarter looks like in numbers compared to previous earnings results.\n\n## Revenue and Net Profit\n\nApple reported total revenue of $83.4 billion for the September quarter, up 29% year-over-year. Although that number missed Wall Street expectations, it represented a new record high for Apple's Q4, which corresponds to the calendar's third quarter.\n\nApple revenue and net profit.\n\nNet profit for the company reached $20.6 billion, up 47.5% year-over-year from the $12.6 billion in net profit tracked in Q4 2020.\n\nYear-over-year percentage changes in revenue and net profit.\n\nEarnings-per-share reached $1.24, up 51.7% from $0.73 cents in the year-ago quarter.\n\n## Gross Margins\n\nGross margins as a percentage of revenue.\n\nGross margins, which are typically a good indicator of Apple's profitability, reached 42.2% in Q4 2021, up from 38.2% in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nQuarterly revenue and gross margins.\n\nThe number isn't record-breaking — the current high is 47.37% in Q2 2012 — but it still represents healthy gross margins for the company.\n\n## R&D\n\nApple, like other technology companies, spends a lot of money on research and development. That money goes toward the creation of new products and technologies.\n\nApple revenue versus R&D costs.\n\nR&D costs continued to rise for Apple, although when you contextualize the R&D numbers with the company's overall revenue, it makes sense why the company is spending so much.\n\n## Annual revenue, gross margin, net income\n\nApple reported total annual sales for 2021 of $365.8 billion, up a significant 33% from the $274.5 billion it reported in 2020. Gross margins for the 2021 year were up 45.6% from the year ago.\n\nAnnual revenue, gross margins, and net income.\n\nApple's costs also rose during 2021. Operating expenses were up 13.5% during the year, and R&D costs rose 16.9%.\n\nHowever, Apple's income also saw increases. The company's operating income was up 64.4% in 2021, and its net income was up 64.9%.\n\nFun facts on annual: Gross sales up 33% YoY for full year. Gross margin up 45.6%, Operating Expenses up 13.5%, R&D up 16.9%, Operating Income up 64.4%, Net Income up 64.9%.\n\n## Products\n\nTaking a broad view of Apple's product categories, it appears that virtually every segment of the company's business grew year-ov"

Adjusted [earnings per share](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp) (EPS) came in at $1.24, ahead of analysts' predicted $1.21. On the other hand, revenue was somewhat below expectations: the company reported quarterly revenue of $83.4 billion relative to a predicted $84.2 billion.\n\nApple's fiscal year ends in September, meaning that this earnings report corresponds to its fiscal fourth quarter.

The company reported services revenue of $18.3 billion as compared with a predicted $17.6 billion for the quarter. Apple's services include the company's digital content stores and streaming services, such as its various App Store platforms, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, and Apple TV+, as well as cloud services, Apple Pay, and other offerings.\n\nServices revenue is especially important as a sign of Apple's financial future because [profit margins](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profitmargin.asp) on services sales are significantly larger than on Apple's hardware profits.

Wall Street analysts were anticipating EPS of $1.77 on revenue of $102.2 billion.\n\nApple's iPhone business, its most important, brought in $49.03 billion in revenue, shy of expectations of $49.3 billion.\n\n“Our September quarter results capped off a record fiscal year, with revenue reaching $416 billion, as well as double-digit EPS growth,” Apple CFO Kevan Parekh said in a statement. [...] Importantly, Apple's fourth quarter accounts for a small portion of iPhone 17 sales, as the phones were only on sale for a few weeks ahead of the end of the financial period. Still, any revenue impact helps to provide guidance for the year ahead.\n\nRead more: Live coverage of corporate earnings\n\nGreater China revenue was also below expectations, coming in at $14.49 billion versus expectations of $16.43 billion.

His coverage areas included audio, home theater, smartphones, and more.\n\nApple today posted strong earnings for its [fourth fiscal 2021 quarter](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results/), reporting all-time highs for its services and Mac divisions. The company says it took in revenue of $83.4 billion, a year-over-year increase of 29 percent, and earnings per share of $1.24. That earnings number came in below Wall Street expectations of $84.85 billion.\n\nCEO Tim Cook [told CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/28/apple-aapl-q4-2021-earnings.html) that supply chain constraints had a clear impact on financial results this quarter. “We had a very strong performance despite larger than expected supply constraints, which we estimate to be around $6 billion,” Cook said, attributing the supply issues to “the industry-wide chip shortages that have been talked about a lot and COVID-related manufacturing disruptions in Southeast Asia.” Apple expects an even greater loss from supply chain issues in the December quarter, it said during Thursday’s earnings call.\n\nThe company is fresh off the launch of several new products, including the [iPhone 13](/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review) and [13 Pro](/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review), a new [iPad mini](/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review), ninth-gen iPad, [Apple Watch Series 7](/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features), third-generation [AirPods](/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review), and most recently, the eagerly anticipated MacBook Pro powered by Apple silicon. The latest iPhones weren’t released until late in the quarter, but the iPhone business as a whole continued to show strong momentum and was up 47 percent over a year ago. The iPad was also up 21 percent over the year-ago quarter.\n\nLike other large tech companies, and as Cook made clear, Apple is dealing with major supply chain challenges: the high-end iPhones remain difficult to find in stock at Apple retail locations, and its 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros are already severely backordered. If you don’t want to deal with long shipping delays, the best option is routinely checking stock at local Apple stores. But even that’s not a guaranteed strategy, and the reality i"
