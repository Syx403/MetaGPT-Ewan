In addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC reports. Following prepared remarks, we will turn the call over for questions. Please limit yourself to one question.\n\nIf you have more than one, please ask your most pressing first, and then reenter the queue. Now, let me turn the call over to James.\n\n**James Quincey** -- *Chairman and Chief Executive Officer*\n\nThanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. 2022 was a strong year for us.
