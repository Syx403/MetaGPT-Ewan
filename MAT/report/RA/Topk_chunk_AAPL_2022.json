        "content": "NOTE3:NETOPERATINGREVENUES\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells:\n· beverage concentrates, sometimes refered to as *beverage bases,” and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our “concentrate\noperations\"); and\n· finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our “finished product operations\").\nGenerally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.\nOur concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which\nwe typically refer as our “bottlers” or our *\"bottling partners\"). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the\nproduct), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and\nrefillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retalers directly or, in some cases, through\nwholesalers or other botlers. In addition, outside the United States, our botting partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which\nthey sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain\nsyrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment.\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished beverages to retailers, or to distributors and\nwholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our\nBottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to\ndistributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company's bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments\nor our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa. These sales are included in our Global Ventures\noperating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate\nconsumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our\nNorth America operating segment.\nRevenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. Our performance obligation generally consists of the\npromise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling partners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers. Control of the concentrates, syrups or finished products is\ntransferred upon shipment to, or receipt at, our customers? locations, as determined by the specific terms of the contract. Upon transfer of control to the customer, which\ncompletes our performance obligation, revenue is recognized. Our sales terms generally do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing\ndefects on our part. After completion of our performance obligation, we have an unconditional right to consideration as outlined in the contract. Our receivables will generally\nbe collected in less than six months, in accordance with the underlying payment terms. All of our performance obligations under the terms of contracts with our customers have\nan original duration of one year or less.\nOur customers and bottling partners may be entitled to cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume-based incentive programs, support for\ninfrastructure programs and other similar programs. In most markets, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned\nfinancial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers always changing neds and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model.\nUnder this model, the price we charge botlers for concentrates they use to prepare and package finished products is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited\nto, the prices charged by the bottlers for such finished products, the channels in which they are sold, and package mix. The amounts associated with the arrangements described\nabove represent variable consideration, an estimate of which is included in the transaction price as a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statement of\nincome upon completion of our performance obligations. The total revenue recorded, including any variable consideration, cannot exceed the amount for which it is probable\nthat a significant reversal will not occur when uncertainties related to variability are resolved. As a result, we are recognizing revenue based on our faithful depiction of the\nconsideration that we expect to receive. In making our estimates of variable consideration, we consider past results and make significant assumptions related to: (1) customer\nsales volumes; (2) customer ending inventories; (3) customer selling price per unit; (4) selling channels; and (5) discount rates, rebates and other pricing allowances, as\napplicable. In gathering data to estimate our variable consideration, we generally calculate our estimates using a portfolio approach at the country and product line level rather\nthan at the individual contract level. The result of making these estimates will impact the line items trade accounts receivable or accounts payable and accrued expenses in our\nconsolidated balance sheet, as applicable. The actual amounts ultimately paid and/or received may be different from our estimates. The change in the amount of variable\nconsideration recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022 related to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods was immaterial.",

During 2021, our Company's acquisitions\nof businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $4,766 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in\nBA Sports Nutrition, LLC (“BodyArmor\"). During 2020, our Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $1,052\nmillion, which primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in fairlife, LLC (*\"fairlife\").\nBASportsNutrition,LLC\nIn November 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 85 percent ownership interest in, and now owns 100 percent of, BodyArmor, which offers a line of sports performance\nand hydration beverages in the United States. We acquired the remaining ownership interest in exchange for approximately $5,600 million of cash, of which $4,745 million was\npaid at close, net of cash acquired. The purchase price reflected the contractual discount included in the purchase option we obtained with our initial investment in 2018. The\nremaining $860 million of the purchase price was held back related to indemnification obligations, of which $540 million was included in the line item accounts payable and\naccrued expenses and $320 million was included in the line item other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31,\n2022, $549 million of the $860 million had been paid and $311 million remained in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet.\nUpon consolidation, we recognized a gain of $834 million resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in BodyArmor to fair value. The fair value of\nour previously held equity interest was determined using a discounted cash flow model based on Level 3 inputs, as defined in Note 16. The gain was recorded in the line item\nother income (loss) —- net in our consolidated statement of income. Upon finalization of purchase accounting, $4.2 billion of the purchase price was allocated to the\nBodyArmor trademark and $2.2 billion was allocated to goodwill, of which $1.2 billion is tax deductible. The goodwill recognized as part of this acquisition is primarily related\nto the synergistic value created from leveraging the capabilities, assets and scale of the Company and the opportunity for international expansion. It also includes certain other\nintangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, such as an assembled workforce. Of the total amount allocated to goodwill, $1.9 billion has been assigned to the\nNorth America operating segment and $O0.3 billion has been assigned to our other geographic operating segments.\nfairlife,LLC\nIn January 2020, the Company acquired the remaining 57.5 percent ownership interest in, and now owns 100 percent of, fairlife. fairlife offers a broad portfolio of products in\nthe value-added dairy category across North America. Upon consolidation, we recognized a gain of $902 million resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held\nequity interest in fairlife to fair value. The fair value of our previously held equity interest was determined using a discounted cash flow model based on Level 3 inputs, as\ndefined in Note 16. The gain was recorded in the line item other income (loss) —— net in our consolidated statement of income. We acquired the remaining ownership interest in\nexchange for $979 million of cash, net of cash acquired, and effectively settled our $306 million note receivable from fairlife at the recorded amount. Under the terms of the\nagreement, we are subject to making future milestone payments which are contingent on fairlife achieving certain financial targets through 2024 and, if achieved, are payable in\n2021, 2023 and 2025. These milestone payments are based on agreed-upon formulas related to fairlife's operating results, the resulting values of which are not subject to a\nceiling. Under the applicable accounting guidance, we recorded a $270 million liability representing our best estimate of the fair value of this contingent consideration as of the\nacquisition date. The fair value of this contingent consideration was determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model based on Level 3 inputs, including management's latest\nestimates of future operating results. We are required to remeasure this liability to fair value quarterly, with any changes in the fair value recorded in income until the final\nmilestone payment is made. Upon finalization of purchase accounting, $1.3 billion of the purchase price was allocated to the fairlife trademark and $0.8 billion was allocated to\ngoodwill. The goodwill recognized as part of this acquisition is primarily related to synergistic value created from the opportunity for additional expansion. It also includes\ncertain other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, such as an assembled workforce. The goodwill is not tax deductible and has been assigned to the\nNorth America operating segment.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded charges of $1,000 million, $369 million and $51 million, respectively. These charges related to the\nremeasurement of the contingent consideration liability to fair value and were recorded in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statements of income.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we made the first milestone payment of $100 million based on fairlife meeting its financial targets in 2020.",

Management believes gross profit margin provides investors with useful information\nrelated to the profitability of our business prior to considering all of the selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating charges incured. Management uses\nthis measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance.\nOur gross profit margin decreased to 58.1 percent in 2022 from 60.3 percent in 2021. This decrease was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange\nrate fluctuations, increased commodity and transportation costs, and the acquisition of BodyArmor, a finished goods business, in November 2021. The impact of these items\nwas partially offset by favorable pricing initiatives as well as favorable channel and package mix. We expect commodity and transportation costs to continue to have an\nunfavorable impact on our gross profit margin in 2023, and we will continue to proactively take actions in an effort to mitigate the impact of these incremental costs\nSelling,GeneralandAdministrativeExpenses\nThe following table sets forth the components of selling, general and administrative expenses (in millions):\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $736 million, or 6 percent, in 2022. This increase was primarily due to increased marketing spending, higher selling and\ndistribution expenses, and higher annual incentive and stock-based compensation expense. The increase in selling and distribution expenses was due to the continued recovery\nfrom the COViD-19 pandemic. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was primarily due to our strong financial performance in 2022 and a more favorable outlook\nof our future financial performance, which resulted in higher payout assumptions as compared to 2021. In 2022, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses by 6 percent.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $325 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based compensation awards granted under our plans, which\nwe expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years as stock-based compensation expense. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-\nbased compensation awards. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.",

        "content": "1 The increase was primarily related to a change in judgment on certain tax positions due to the Opinion. Refer to Note 1l of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the line item income taxes on our consolidated statement of income. The Company had\n$453 million and $391 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Of these amounts, expense\nof $62 million and $190 million was recognized in 2021 and 2020, respectively. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would\nbe a benefit to the Company's effective tax rate.\nBased on current tax laws, the Company's effective tax rate in 2022 is expected to be approximately 20 percent before considering the potential impact of any significant\noperating and nonoperating items that may affect our effective tax rate.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position\nWe believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of the fundamental strengths of our business. Refer to the heading “Cash Flows from Operating\nActivities” below. The Company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase\nour return on shareowners? equity. Refer to the heading “Cash Flows from Financing Activities\" below. We have a history of borrowing funds both domestically and\ninternationally at reasonable interest rates, and we expect to be able to continue to borrow funds at reasonable rates over the long term. Our debt financing also includes the use\nof a commercial paper program. We currently have the ability to borrow funds in this market at levels that are consistent with our debt financing strategy and expect to continue\nto be able to do so in the future.\nThe Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and, as a result of this review, during 2021 we issued U.S. dollar- and euro-denominated long-\nterm notes of $6.0 billion and E3.2 billion, respectively, across various maturities. We used a portion of the proceeds from these issuances to extinguish certain tranches of our\npreviously issued long-term debt. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these issuances and extinguishments.\nThe Company's cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities totaled $12.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. In addition to these funds, our\ncommercial paper program and our ability to issue long-term debt, we had $8.1 billion in unused backup lines of credit for general corporate purposes as of December 31, 2021.\nThese backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2022 through 2027.\nWhile uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic remain, we expect to continue to see improvements in our business as vaccines become more widely available. The\ntiming and availability of vaccines will be different around the world, and therefore we believe the pace of the recovery will vary by geography depending on vaccine\navailability, rates of vaccination and the effectiveness of vaccines against existing and new variants of the virus, along with other macroeconomic factors. We will remain\nflexible so that we can adjust to uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our current capital allocation priorities are as follows: investing wisely to support our\nbusiness operations, continuing to grow our dividend payment, enhancing our beverage portfolio and capabilities through opportunistic and disciplined acquisitions, and using\nexcess cash to repurchase shares over time. We currently expect 2022 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.5 billion. During 2022, we also expect to repurchase\napproximately $500 million of shares in addition to repurchasing shares equivalent to the proceeds from the issuances of stock under our stock-based compensation plans.\nWe are currently in litigation with the IRS for tax years 2007 through 2009. On November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion in which it predominantly sided with the\nIRS; however, a final decision is still pending and the timing of such decision is not currently known. The Company strongly disagrees with the IRS' positions and the portions\nof the Opinion affrming such positions and intends to vigorously defend our positions uilizing every available avenue of appeal. While the Company believes that i is more\nlikely than not that we will ultimately prevail in this litigation upon appeal, it is possible that all, or some portion of, the adjustments proposed by the IRS and sustained by the\nTax Court could ultimately be upheld. In the event that all of the adjustments proposed by the IRS are ultimately upheld for tax years 2007 through 2009 and the IRS, with the\nconsent of the federal courts, were to decide to apply the Tax Court Methodology to the subsequent years up to and including 2021, the Company currently estimates that the\npotential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $13 billion as of December 31, 2021. Additional income tax and interest would continue to\naccrue until the time any such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. Once the Tax Court renders a final decision, the Company will have 90 days to file a notice\nof appeal and pay the portion of the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which we currently estimate to be\napproximately $4.9 billion (including interest accrued through December 31, 2021), plus any additional interest accrued through the time of payment. Refer to Note 11 of Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the tax litigation.\nWhile we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail in the tax litigation discussed above, we are confident that, between our ability to generate cash flows from\noperating activities and our ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates, we can manage the range of possible outcomes in the final resolution of the matter.\nBased on all of the aforementioned factors, the Company believes its current liquidity position is strong and will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and\ncash commitments for investing and financing activities for the foreseeable future.\nCashFlowsfromOperatingActivities\nAs part of our continued efforts to improve our working capital efficiency, we have worked with our suppliers over the past several years to revisit terms and conditions,\nincluding the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers are 120 days. Additionally, two global financial institutions offer a\nvoluntary supply chain finance (*SCF\") program which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to these\nfinancial institutions on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus may be more beneficial to them. The SCF program is available to suppliers of\ngoods and services included in cost of goods sold as well as suppliers of goods and services included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated\nstatement of income. The Company and our suppliers agree on the contractual terms for the goods and services we procure, including prices, quantities and payment terms,\nregardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the SCF program. The suppliers sell goods or services, as applicable, to the Company and issue the associated invoices\nto the Company based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. Then, if they are participating in the SCF program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which\ninvoices, if any, they want to sell to the financial institutions. Our suppliers? voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms. No\nguarantees are provided by the Company or any of our subsidiaries under the SCF program. We have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate in the SCF\nprogram, and we have ndirect financial relationshp with the financial institutions, asit relates to the CF program.Accordingly,amounts u to our suppliers that elctd t\nparticipate in the SCF program are included in the line itm accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. Allactivity relatd to amounts de to\nsuppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program is reflected within the operating activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. We have been informed\nby the financial institutions that as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, suppliers had elected to sell $882 million and $703 million, respectively, of our outstanding payment\nobligations to the financial institutions. The amounts settled through the SCF program were $3,237 million and $2,810 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and\n2020, respectively. We do not believe there is a risk that our payment terms will be shortened in the near future.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company started a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. Under this program we can elect to sell trade accounts\nreceivables to unaffliated fnancial institutions a a discount. In these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the Company collcts customer payments related t\nthe factored receivables and remits those payments to the financial institutions. The Company sold $6,266 million and $185 million of trade accounts receivables under this\nprogram during the years ended Decmber 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and the costs of factoring such receivables were not material. The cash received from the financial\ninstitutions is classified within the operating activities section in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $12,625 million and $9,844 million, respectively, an increase of $2,781 million,\nor 28 percent. This increase was primarily driven by increased operating income, which includes a benefit from our trade accounts receivable factoring program, a favorable\nimpact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, lower annual incentive payments in 2021 as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operating\nperformance in 2020, lower payments in 2021 of prior year-end marketing accruals due to lower spending in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and lower\nprepayments to customers in 2021. These items were partially ofset by higher payments related to our strategic realignment initiatives along with higher tax payments in 2021.\nCashFlowsfromInvestingActivities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2,765 million and $1,477 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nPurchases of Investments and Proceeds fromDisposals of Investments\nIn 2021, purchases of investments were $6,030 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $7,059 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $1,029 million. In\n2020, purchases of investments were $13,583 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $13,835 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $252 million. This\nactivity primarily represents the purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments in marketable securities and short-term investments that were made as part of the\nCompany's overall cash management strategy. Also included in this activity are purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments held by our captive insurance\ncompanies.\nAcquisitions of Businesses,EquityMethod Investments and NonmarketableSecurities\nIn 2021, the Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $4,766 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of\nthe remaining ownership interest in BodyArmor.\nIn 2020, the Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $1,052 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of\nthe remaining ownership interest in fairlife.\nRefer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions.\nProceeds fromDisposals ofBusinesses,Equity Method Investments and NonmarketableSecurities\nIn 2021, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities were $2,180 million, which primarily related to the sale of our\nownership interest in CCA, an equity method investee, to CCEP, also an equity method investee.\nIn 2020, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities were $189 million, which primarily related to the sale of our\nownership interest in Piedmont Coca-Cola Bottling Partnership to Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., an equity method investee.\nRefer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our disposals.\nPurchasesofProperty,PlantandEquipment\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $1,367 million and $1,177 million, respectively\nTotal capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and the percentage of such totals by operating segment and Corporate were as follows (in millions):\nCashFlowsfromFinancingActivities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $6,786 million and $8,070 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively\nDebt Financing\nOur Company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our\noverall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners? equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our\ncredit ratings.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our long-term debt was rated “A+\" by Standard & Poor's and “A1\" by Moody's. Our commercial paper program was rated “A-1\" by Standard &\nPoor's and *p-1 by Moody's. In assessing our credit strength, both rating agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and\nfinancial policies as well as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, certain rating agencies also consider the financial\ninformation of certain bottlers, including CCEP, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation for the\ndebt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company's business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep\nthese bottlers viable. It is our expectation that these rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in\nour capital structure, our major bottlers? financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our\ncost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers credit ratings were to decline, the Company's equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential\nincrease in interest expense for those bottlers.\nWe monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different\naggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our\nCompany.\nOur global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to borrow funds at a low effective cost. This posture,\ncoupled with active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt as well as our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of\nborrowing. Our debt management policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase program and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets.\nIssuances and payments of debt included both short-term and long-term financing activities. During 2021, the Company had issuances of debt of $13,094 million, which\nincluded $3,391 million of issuances related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and $80 million of net issuances related to\ncommercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less. The Company's total long-term debt issuances were $9,623 million, net of related discounts and\nissuancecosts.\nDuring 2021, the Company made payments of debt of $12,866 million, which consisted of $2,357 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with\nmaturities greater than 90 days and payments of long-term debt of $10,509 million.\nDuring 2020, the Company had issuances of debt of $26,934 million, which included $8,260 million of issuances related to commercial paper and short-term debt with\nmaturities greater than 90 days and long-term debt issuances of $18,674 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs.\nDuring 2020, the Company made payments of debt of $28,796 million, which included $15,292 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with\nmaturities greater than 90 days and $1,768 million net issuances related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less. The Company's total\npayments of long-term debt were $11,736 million.\nOn December 31, 2021, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, the governing body responsible for regulating LIBOR, ceased to publish certain LIBOR reference\nrates. However, other LIBOR reference rates, including U.S. dollar overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month maturities will continue to be published through June\n2023. In preparation for the discontinuation of LIBOR, wehave amended, or willamend, our LOR-referencing agreements to either reference the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate or include mechanics for selecting an alternative rate. We do not plan to enter into variable-rate agreements that reference LIOR after Decmber 31, 2021.\nIssuancesofStock\nThe issuances of stock in 2021 and 2020 were related to the exercise of stock options by Company employees.\nShareRepurchases\nIn 2012, the Board ofDirectors authorized a share repurchase plan ofup to 500 millon shares of the Company's common stock. In 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a\nnew plan for the Company to purchase up to an additional 150 million shares of our common stock\nDuring 2021 and 2020, the Company did not repurchase common stock under the share repurchase plan authorized by our Board of Directors. Since the inception of our share\nrepurchase program in 1984, we have purchased 3.5 billion shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $17.25. In addition to shares repurchased under the\nshare repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors, the Company's treasury stock activity also includes shares surrendered to the Company to pay the exercise\nprice and/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so-called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and/or the vesting of restricted stock issued to\nemployees. The Company's treasury stock activity during 2021 resulted in a cash outflow of $111 million.\nDividends\nThe Company paid dividends of $7,252 million and $7,047 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAt its February 2022 meeting, our Board of Directors increased our regular quarterly dividend to $0.44 per share, equivalent to a full year dividend of $1.76 per share in 2022.\nThis is our 60th consecutive annual increase. Our annualized common stock dividend was $1.68 per share and $1.64 per share in 2021 and 2020, respectively.",

Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion regarding the Company's 2015 litigation with the IRS involving transfer pricing tax adjustments in which the court\npredominantly sided with the IRS. The Company disagrees with the Opinion and intends to vigorously defend its position. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $926 million. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would\nbe a benefit of $617 million, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties. The remaining $309 million primarily represents tax benefits that would be received in\ndifferent tax jurisdictions in the event the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions.\nA reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the line item income taxes in our consolidated statement of income. The Company had\n$496 million and $453 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of these amounts, expense\nof $43 million and $62million was recognized in 2022 and 2021, respectively. If the Company were to prevail on alluncertain tax positions, the reversal of this acrual woud\nbe a benefit to the Company's effective tax rate.\nBased on current tax laws, the Company's effective tax rate in 2023 is expected to be approximately 19.5 percent before considering the potential impact of any significant\noperating and nonoperating items that may affect our effective tax rate.\nLIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND FINANCIAL POSITION\nWe believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of the fundamental strengths of our business. Refer to the heading “Cash Flows from Operating\nActivities\" below. The Company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase\nour return on shareowners? equity. Refer to the heading “Cash Flows from Financing Activities\"? below. We have a history of borrowing funds both domestically and\ninternationally at reasonable interest rates, and we expect to be able to continue to borrow funds at reasonable rates over the long term. Our debt financing also includes the use\nof a commercial paper program. We currently have the ability to borrow funds in this market at levels that are consistent with our debt financing strategy, and we expect to\ncontinue to be able to do so in the future. The Company regularly reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt.\nThe Company's cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities totaled $11.6 billion as of December 31, 2022. In addition to these funds, our\ncommercial paper program and our ability to issue long-term debt, we had $4.4 billion in unused backup lines of credit for general corporate purposes as of December 31, 2022.\nThese backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2023 through 2028.\nOur current capital allocation priorities are as follows: investing wisely to support our business operations, continuing to grow our dividend payment, enhancing our beverage\nportfolio and capabilities through consumer-centric acquisitions, and using excess cash to repurchase shares over time. We currently expect 2023 capital expenditures to be\napproximately $1.9 billion. During 2023, we also expect to repurchase shares to offset dilution resulting from employee stock-based compensation plans.\nWe are currently in litigation with the IRS for tax years 2007 through 2009. On November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion in which it predominantly sided with the\nIRS; however, a final decision is still pending and the timing of such decision is not currently known. The Company strongly disagrees with the IRS' positions and the portions\nof the Opinion affrming such positions and intends to vigorously defend our positions utilizing every available avenue of appeal. While the Company believes that it is more\nlikely than not that we will ultimately prevail in this litigation upon appeal, it is possible that all, or some portion of, the adjustments proposed by the IRS and sustained by the\nTax Court could ultimately be upheld. In the event that all of the adjustments proposed by the IRS were ultimately upheld for tax years 2007 through 2009 and the IRS, with the\nconsent of the federal courts, were to decide to apply the Tax Court Methodology to the subsequent years up to and including 2022, the Company currently estimates that the\npotential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $14 billion as of December 31, 2022. Additional income tax and interest would continue to\naccrue until the time any such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. Once the Tax Court renders a final decision, the Company will have 90 days to file a notice\nof appeal and pay the portion of the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which we currently estimate to be\napproximately $5.2 billion (including interest accrued through December 31, 2022), plus any additional interest accrued through the time of payment. Refer to Note 11 of Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the tax litigation.\nWhile we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail in the tax litigation discussed above, we are confident that, between our ability to generate cash flows from\noperating activities and our ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates, we can manage the range of possible outcomes in the final resolution of the matter.\nBased on all of the aforementioned factors, the Company believes its current liquidity position is strong and will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and\ncash commitments for investing and financing activities for the foreseeable future.\nCashFlowsfromOperatingActivities\nAs part of our continued efforts to improve our working capital efficiency, we have worked with our suppliers over the past several years to revisit terms and conditions,\nincluding the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers are 120 days. Additionally, two global financial institutions offer a\nvoluntary supply chain finance (SCF\") program which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to selltheir receivables from the Company to these financial institutions\non a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus may be more beneficial to them. The SCF program is available to suppliers of goods and services\nincluded in cost of goods sold as well as suppliers of goods and services included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. The\nCompany and our suppliers agree on contractual terms for the goods and services we procure,including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier\nelects to participate in the SCF program. The suppliers sell goods or services, as applicable, to the Company and issue the associated invoices to the Company based on the\nagreed-upon contractual terms. Then, if they are participating in the SCF program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which invoices, if any, they want to sell to\nthe financial institutions. Our suppliers′ voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms. No guarantees are provided by the Company\nor any of our subsidiaries under the SCF program. We have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate in the SCF program, and we have no direct financial\nrelationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to the SCF program. Accordingly, amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program are\nincluded in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. All activity related to amounts due to suppliers that elected to participate in\nthe SCF program is reflected within the operating activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. We have been informed by the financial institutions that as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, suppliers had elected to sell $1,234 million and $882 million, respectively, of our outstanding payment obligations to the financial institutions.\nThe amounts settled through the SCF program were $4,724 million and $3,237 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We do not believe\nthere is a risk that our payment terms will be shortened in the near future.\nThe Company has a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. Under this program, we can elect to sell trade accounts receivables to unaffiliated financial\ninstitutions at a discount. In these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the Company collects customer payments related to the factored receivables and remits\nthose payments to the financial institutions. The Company sold $10,709 million and $6,266 million of trade accounts receivables under this program during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The costs of factoring such receivables were $27 million and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. The cash received from the financial institutions is classified within the operating activities section in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $11,018 million and $12,625 million, respectively, a decrease of $1,607 million,\nor 13 percent. This decrease was primarily driven by higher marketing payments resulting from 2021 year-end accruals, an unfavorable impact due to foreign currency\nexchange rate fluctuations, the buildup of inventory to manage potential supply chain disruptions, and higher annual incentive and tax payments in 2022. These items were\npartially offset by increased operating income, lower payments related to our strategic realignment initiatives, and increased benefits from the extension of certain vendor\npayment terms and our trade accounts receivable factoring program.\nCashFlowsfromInvestingActivities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $763 million and $2,765 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nPurchases of Investments andProceedsfromDisposals of Investments\nIn 2022, purchases of investments were $3,751 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $4,771 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $1,020 million. In\n2021, purchases of investments were $6,030 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $7,059 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $1,029 million. This\nactivity primarily represents the purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments in marketable securities and short-term investments that were made as part of the\nCompany's overall cash management strategy. Also included in this activity are purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments held by our captive insurance\ncompanies.\nAcquisitions ofBusinesses,EquityMethod Investments andNonmarketableSecurities\nIn 2022, the Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $73 million.\nIn 2021, the Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $4,766 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of\nthe remaining ownership interest in BodyArmor.\nRefer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions.\nProceeds from Disposals of Businesses,Equity Method Investments andNonmarketableSecurities\nIn 2022, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $458 million, which primarily related to the refranchising of\nour bottling operations in Cambodia and the sale of our ownership interest in one of our equity method investments.\nIn 2021, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $2,180 million, which primarily related to the sale of our\nownership interest in CCA, an equity method investe, to CCEP, also an equity method investe.\nRefer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our disposals.\nPurchasesofProperty,Plant andEquipment\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $1,484 million and $1,367 million, respectively.\nCollateral paid associated with our hedging activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 was $1,465 million. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements for additional information on our hedging activities.\nOtherInvestingActivities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total cash inflow for other investing activities was $706 million and $51 million, respectively. The activities during\n2022 included cash proceeds of $823 million received in advance of the refranchising of our bottling operations in Vietnam. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements for additional information on this transaction.\nCashFlowsfromFinancingActivities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $10,250 million and $6,786 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nDebt Financing\nOur Company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our\noverall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners? equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our\ncredit ratings.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our long-term debt was rated “A+”\" by Standard & Poor's and “A1\" by Moody's. Our commercial paper program was rated “A-1”\" by Standard &\nPoor's and “P-1”\" by Moody's. In assessing our credit strength, both rating agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and\nfinancial policies as well as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, certain rating agencies also consider the financial\ninformation of certain bottlers, including CCEP, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation for the\ndebt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company's business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep\nthese bottlers viable. It is our expectation that these rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in\nour capital structure, our major bottlers^ financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies? methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our\ncost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers credit ratings were to decline, the Company's equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential\nincreaseininterest expensefor thosebottlers.\nWe monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different\naggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our\nCompany.\nOur global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to borrow funds at a low effective cost. This posture,\ncoupled with active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt as well as our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of\nborrowing. Our debt management policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase program and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets.\nIssuances and payments of debt included both short-term and long-term financing activities. During 2022, the Company had issuances of debt of $3,972 million, which\nincluded $2,321 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days, $798 million of net issuances of commercial paper and\nshort-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less, and long-term debt issuances of $853 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs.\nDuring 2022, the Company made payments of debt of $4,930 million, which consisted of $3,623 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with\nmaturities greater than 90 days and payments of long-term debt of $1,307 million.\nDuring 2021, the Company had issuances of debt of $13,094 million, which included $3,391 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities\ngreater than 90 days, $80 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less and long-term debt issuances of $9,623 million,\nnet of related discounts and issuance costs.\nDuring 2021, the Company made payments of debt of $12,866 million, which consisted of $2,357 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with\nmaturities greater than 90 days and payments of long-term debt of $10,509 million.\nOn December 31, 2021, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, the governing body responsible for regulating LIBOR, ceased to publish certain LIBOR reference\nrates. However, other LIBOR reference rates, including U.S. dollar overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month maturities, will continue to be published through June\n2023. In preparation for the discontinuation of LIBOR, we have amended, or will amend, our LIBOR-referencing agreements to either reference the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate or include mechanics for selecting an alternative rate. We do not plan to enter into variable-rate agreements that reference LIBOR in the future.\nIssuancesofStock\nThe issuances of stock in 2022 and 2021 were related to the exercise of stock options by employees.\nShareRepurchases\nIn 2012, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan of up to 500 million shares (*2012 Plan\") of the Company's common stock. In May 2022, the Company\nreached the maximum number of shares that could be repurchased under the 2012 Plan and thereby completed the plan. In 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a new share\nrepurchase plan of up to 150 million shares of the Company's common stock.\nDuring 2022, the total cash outflow for treasury stock purchases was $1,418 million. The Company repurchased 21.3 million shares of common stock under the share\nrepurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors. These shares were repurchased at an average price per share of $62.67, for a total cost of $1,336 million. Since the\ninception of our share repurchase program in 1984, we have repurchased 3.5 billion shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $17.53. In addition to shares\nrepurchased under the share repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors, the Company's treasury stock activity also includes shares surrendered to the Company to\npay the exercise price and/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so-called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and/or the vesting of restricted\nstock issued to employees. The net impact of the Company's issuances of stock and share repurchases during 2022 resulted in a net cash outflow of $581 million.\nDuring 2021, the Company did not repurchase shares of our common stock under the share repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors.\nDividends\nThe Company paid dividends of $7,616 million and $7,252 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAt its February 2023 meeting, our Board of Directors increased our regular quarterly dividend to $0.46 per share, equivalent to a full year dividend of $1.84 per share in 20231\nThis is our 61st consecutive annual increase. Our annualized common stock dividend was $1.76 per share and $1.68 per share in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOtherFinancingActivities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total cash outflow for other financing activities was $1,095 million and $353 million, respectively. The activities\nduring 2022 included payments totaling $637 million related to the BodyArmor acquisition, which included amounts originally held back for indemnification obligations.\nAdditionally, other financing activities during 2022 and 2021 included repayments of collateral related to our hedging programs.\n55\nRefer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding loans and notes payable. Upon payment of outstanding commercial paper, we typically issue\nnew commercial paper. Lines of credit and other short-term borrowings are expected to fluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs, especially at international subsidiaries.",

        "content": "1 The dividend yield is the calculated yield on the closing market price per share of the Company's stock on the grant date.\n2 The expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on the Company's stock, historical volatility of the Company's stock and other factors.\n3 The risk-free interest rate for the period matching the expected term of the stock options is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the grant date.\n4 The expected term of the stock options represents the period of time that stock options are expected to be outstanding and is derived by analyzing historical exercise behavior.\nStock option awards generally expire 10 years after the grant date. The shares of common stock to be issued and/or sold upon the exercise of stock options are made available\nfrom either authorized and unissued common stock or from treasury shares. Since 2007, the Company has issued common stock under its stock-based compensation plans from\ntreasury shares.\nStock option activity during the year ended December 31, 2022 was as follows:\nThe total intrinsic value of the stock options exercised was $534 million, $358 million and $453 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total number of stock options\nexercised was 22 million, 19 million and 23 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nPerformance-BasedShareUnitAwards\nPerformance share unit awards require achievement of certain performance criteria, which are predefined by the Talent and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors\nat the time of grant. For performance share unit awards granted from 2015 through 2017, the performance criteria were economic profit and net operating revenues over a\npredefined performance period of three years. Economic profit is our net operating profit after tax less the cost of the capital used in our business. Economic profit and net\noperating revenues were adjusted for certain items, which were approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The purpose of these adjustments was to ensure a\nconsistent year-to-year comparison of the specific performance criteria. Most of these awards included a relative TSR modifier to determine the final number of performance\nshare units earned. For these awards, the number of performance share units earned based on the certified achievement of the predefined\n93\nperformance criteria was reduced or increased if the Company's total shareowner return over the performance period relative to a predefined compensation comparator group of\ncompanies fell outside of a predefined range. The fair value of these performance share units was determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The performance share unit\nawards granted from 2015 through 2017 were subject to a one-year holding period after the performance period before the shares were released.\nFor performance share unit awards granted from 2018 through 2022, the performance criteria were equally weighted among net operating revenues, earnings per share and free\ncash flow over a predefined performance period of three years. For performance share unit awards granted to executives in 2022, the performance criteria were weighted 30\npercent for net operating revenues, 30 percent for earnings per share, 30 percent for free cash flow and 10 percent for environmental sustainability. For purposes of these\nperformance criteria, earnings per share is diluted net income per share; free cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and\nequipment; and environmental sustainability is comprised of predefined goals related to the Company's packaging and water security strategies. These performance criteria are\nadjusted for certain items, if applicable, which are subject to Audit Committee approval. The purpose of these adjustments is to ensure a consistent year-to-year comparison of\nthe specific performance criteria. Performance share unit awards granted to executives include a relative TSR modifier to determine the final number of performance share units\nearned. The fair value of performance share units that include a TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. For these awards, the number of\nperformance share units earned based on the certified achievement of the predefined performance criteria will be reduced or increased if the Company's total shareowner return\nover the performance period relative to a predefined compensation comparator group of companies falls outside of a predefined range. The fair value of performance share units\nthat do not include a TSR modifier is the closing market price per share of the Company's stock on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not received\nduring the performance period. The performance share unit awards will generally vest at the end of the respective performance period.\nDuring 2021, in addition to granting performance share unit awards with a three-year performance period, the Company granted emerging stronger performance share unit\nawards with a predefined performance period of two years. The award's performance criterion was earnings per share, and the award included a relative TSR modifier. Earnings\nper share for these purposes was diluted net income per share adjusted for certain items, which were approved by the Audit Committee. The purpose of these adjustments was\nto ensure a consistent year-to-year comparison of the performance criterion. These performance share unit awards generally vested at the end of the two-year performance\nperiod.\nFor performance share unit awards, in the event the certified results equal the predefined performance criteria, the number of performance share units earned will be equal to\nthe target award. In the event the certified results exceed the predefined performance criteria, additional performance share units up to the maximum award will be earned. In\nthe event the certified results fall below the predefined performance criteria but are at or above the minimum threshold, a reduced number of performance share units will be\nearned. If the certified results fall below the minimum threshold, no performance share units will be earned. Performance share unit awards do not entitle participants to vote or\nreceive dividends until the performance share units are settled in stock.\nIn the reporting period it becomes probable that the minimum performance threshold specified in the performance share unit award will be achieved, we recognize\ncompensation expense for the proportionate share of the total fair value of the performance share units related to the vesting period that has already lapsed for the performance\nshare units expected to vest. The remaining fair value of the performance share units expected to vest is expensed on a straight-line basis over the remainder of the vesting\nperiod. In the event the Company determines it is no longer probable that the minimum performance threshold specified in the award will be achieved, we reverse all previously\nrecognized compensation expense in the reporting period such a determination is made.\nPerformance share units earned are generally settled in stock, except for certain circumstances such as death or disability, in which case beneficiaries or employees are provided\ncash payments. As of December 31, 2022, nonvested performance share units of approximately 1,949,000 and 1,757,000 were outstanding for the 2021-2023 and 2022-2024\nperformance periods, respectively, based on the target award amounts.\nWeighted-Average\n1Represents the target level of performance share units vested as of December 31, 2022 for the 2020-2022 and 2021-2022 performance periods. Upon certification in February 2023 of the\nfinancial results for the performance periods, the final number of shares earned will be determined and released.",

        "content": "Leases\nWe determine if a contract contains a lease at its inception based on whether or not the Company has the right to control the asset during the contract period and other facts and\ncircumstances. We are the lessee in a lease contract when we obtain the right to control the asset. Operating lease right-of-use (*ROU\") assets represent our right to use an\nunderlying asset for the lease term and are included in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities represent our obligation\nto make lease payments arising from the lease and are included in the line items accounts payable and accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated\nbalance sheet. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at\nthe commencement date. When determining the lease term, we include renewal or termination options that we are reasonably certain to exercise. Leases with a lease term of 12\nmonths or less at inception are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in our\nconsolidated statement of income. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our local incremental borrowing rate based on the information available\nat the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. When our contracts contain lease and non-lease components, we account for both components\nas a single lease component. Refer to Note 9.\nWe have various contracts for certain fountain equipment under which we are the lessor. These leases meet the criteria for operating lease classification. Lease income\nassociated with these leases is not material.\nProperty,PlantandEquipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Repair and maintenance costs that do not improve service potential or extend economic life are expensed as incurred.\nDepreciation is recorded principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets, which are reviewed periodically and generally have the following\nranges: buildings and improvements: 40 years or less; and machinery and equipment: 20 years or less. Land is not depreciated, and construction in progress is not depreciated\nuntil ready for service. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term, including renewal options that we are\nreasonably certain to exercise, or the estimated useful life of the improvement. Depreciation is not recorded during the period in which a long-lived asset or disposal group is\nclassified as held for sale, even if the asset or disposal group continues to generate revenue during the period. Depreciation expense, including the depreciation expense of\nassets under finance leases, totaled $1, 125 million, $1,262 million and $1,301 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Amortization expense for leasehold improvements\ntotaled $13 million, $15 million and $18 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCertain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment should be assessed, including, among\nothers, a significant derease in market val, a significant change in thebusines clmate ina particular market, oracurrent period operating r cash flow los combind with\nhistorical losses or projected future losses. When such events or changes in circumstances are present and a recoverability test is performed, we estimate the future cash flows\nexpected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal\nplanning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The\nimpairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine\nthe fair value of property, plant and equipment, including appraisals and discounted cash flow models. These appraisals and models include assumptions we believe are\nconsistent with those a market participant would use.\nGoodwill,Trademarks andOtherIntangibleAssets\nWe classify intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to\namortization; and (3) goodwill. We determine the useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each\nintangible asset. Factors we consider when determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement related to the asset, the historical performance of the asset,\nthe Company's long-term strategy for using the asset, any laws or other local regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset, and other economic factors, including\ncompetition and specific market conditions. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized, primarily on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives,\nwhich is less than 20 years. Refer to Note 7.\nWhen events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, management performs a recoverability test of the\ncarrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting profit and cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual\ndisposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without\ninterest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the\nasset or asset group exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models, which include\nassumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use.\nWe test intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events\nor circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Our Company performs these annual impairment tests as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We use a variety of\nmethodologies in conducting impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models, which include assumptions we\nbelieve are consistent with those a market participant would use. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an\nimpairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other\nthan goodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its\ncarrying amount. I the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any\nfurtherassessment.\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on\ngeographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our geographic operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller\ngeographic regions. These geographic regions are our reporting units. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa Limited (*Costa\"), innocent and\ndogadan businesses, as well as fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the Company and Monster Beverage Corporation (*Monster\"), each of\nwhich is its own reporting unit. The Bottling\nInvestments operating segment includes all of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location. Generally, each consolidated bottling operation within\nour Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each\nbusiness combination.\nIn order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value,\nincluding goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the\nfair value. However, the impairment charge recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. We typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair\nvalue of a reporting unit. The assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe a market participant would use. The Company has the option to perform a\nqualitative assessment of goodwill in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the\nCompany concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing discussed above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further assessment.\nImpairment charges related to intangible assets, including goodwill, are generally recorded in the line item other operating charges or, to the extent they relate to equity method\ninvestees, in the line item equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income.",

      {
        "content": "RecoverabilityofCurrent andNoncurrentAssets\nOur Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries and territories in which we operate,\nparticularly in developing and emerging markets. Refer to the heading “Our Business — Challenges and Risks\" above and “Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in Part I of this report. As a\nresult, management must make numerous assumptions, which involve a significant amount of judgment, when performing recoverability and impairment tests of current and\nnoncurent assets in various regions around the world.\nWe perform recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For certain assets, recoverability and/or impairment tests are\nrequired only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently\nif events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.\nThe performance of recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets involves critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management\njudgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others,\nthe economic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, the impact of any supply chain disruptions, inflation, long-term\ngrowth rates, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending, proceeds from the sale of assets and customers? financial\ncondition. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. These factors are even more\ndifficult to estimate as a result of uncertainties associated with the scope, severity and duration of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The estimates we use when performing\nrecoverability tests of assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using\nmanagement's best assumptions, which we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. The Company has certain intangible and other long-lived assets\nthat are more dependent on cash flows generated in away-from-home channels and/or that generate cash flows in geographic areas which are more heavily impacted by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, and therefore these assets are more susceptible to impairment. In addition, intangible and other long-lived assets we acquired in recent transactions are\nnaturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions at the time of acquisition. If\nwe had used other assumptions and estimates when impairment tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. Furthermore, if management uses different\nassumptions in future periods, or if different conditions exist in future periods, impairment charges could result. The total future impairment charges we may be required to\nrecord could be material. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent acquisitions. Refer to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for the discussion of impairment charges. Refer to the heading “Operations Review? below for additional information related to our present business\nenvironment.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investment in Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings Inc. (*\"CCBJHI\") exceeded its fair value by $29 million, or 8 percent.\nBased on the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than our carrying value and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time\nsufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, management determined that the decline in fair value was temporary in nature. Therefore, we did not record an\nimpairment charge related to the investment.\nOur equity method investees also perform such recoverability and impairment tests. If an impairment charge is recorded by one of our equity method investes, the Company\nrecords its proportionate share of such charge as a reduction of equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. However, the actual amount we record with\nrespect to our proportionate share of such charge may be impacted by items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains.\nInvestmentsinEquityandDebtSecurities\nWe measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value with the change in fair value included in\nnet income. We use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without readily determinable\nfair values, we have elected the measurement lternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, i any, plus or minus changes resulting from\nobservable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual\nbasis.\nOur investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. The cost basis is determined by the specific identification method. Investments in debt\nsecurities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities\nthat are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading debt\nsecurities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale debt\nsecurities are included in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), except for the changes in fair values attributable to\nthe currency risk being hedged, if applicable, which are included in net income.\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method and debt securities classified as trading are not assessed for\nimpairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. Equity method investments, equity securities without readily determinable\nfair values and debt securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are reviewed each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in\ncircumstances has occured that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to\nour cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. The fair values\nof most of our Company's investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded\ncompanies, management's assessment of fair value is based on various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds, and appraisals, as\nappropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or\nestimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the\ndetermination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other\nthan temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair\nvalue is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term\nprospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.\nProperty,PlantandEquipment\nCertain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount or remaining useful life of property, plant and equipment should be\nassessed, including, among others, the manner or length of time in which the Company intends to use the asset, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in\nthe business climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses and/or projected future losses. When such events or\nchanges in circumstances are present and a recoverability test is performed, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its\neventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and\nwithout interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount\nexceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment, including appraisals and discounted cash flow models.\nThese appraisals and models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use.\nGoodwill,TrademarksandOtherIntangibleAssets\nIntangible assets are classified into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to\namortization; and (3) goodwill. For intangible assets with definite lives, recoverability tests must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be\nrecoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, impairment tests must be performed at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances\nindicate that an asset may be impaired.\nThe performance of recoverability and impairment tests of intangible assets involves critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment,\ninclude inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the\neconomic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, the impact of any supply chain disruptions, inflation, long-term growth\nrates, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending, proceeds from the sale of assets and customers financial condition.\nThese factors are even more difficult to predict when global financial markets are highly volatile. The estimates we use when performing recoverability tests of intangible assets\nare consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions,\nwhich we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. The estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate. The\nvariability of these factors depends on a number\nof conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. If other assumptions and estimates had been used\nwhen these tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. As mentioned above, these factors do not change in isolation and, therefore, we do not believe it is\npracticable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future periods or if different conditions\nexist in future periods, impairment charges could result. Refer to the heading “Operations Review? below for additional information related to our present business\nenvironment.\nIntangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and\nmacroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if operating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it\ncould result in the impairment of the acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in\nour cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates.\nAdditionally, we are required to ensure that the assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the asumptions that we believe a market\nparticipant would use. As a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of\nwhether our Company's actual cost of capital has changed. Therefore, if the cost of capital and/or discount rates change, our Company may recognize an impairment of an\nintangible asset in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts.\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on\ngeographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our geographic operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller\ngeographic regions. These geographic regions are our reporting units. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa, innocent and dogadan\nbusinesses, as well as fes earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the Company and Monster, each of which is its own reporting unit. The Bottling\nInvestments operating segment includes all of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location. Generally, each consolidated bottling operation within\nour Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each\nbusinesscombination.\nIn order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting\nunit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. However, the impairment\ncharge recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. We typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The\nassumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe a market participant would use. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of\ngoodwill rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying\namount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing discussed above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further\nassessment.\nWhen events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, management performs a recoverability test of the\ncarrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our\ninternal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, we\nrecognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to\ndetermine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models. These models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant\nwould use.\nWe test indefinite-lived intangible assets, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate\nthat an asset may be impaired. Our Company performs these annual impairment tests as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We use a variety of methodologies in\nconducting impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models. These models include assumptions we believe are\nconsistent with those a market participant would use. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment\ncharge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than\ngoodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its\ncarrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any\nfurther assessment.",

        "content": "RecoverabilityofCurrent andNoncurrentAssets\nOur Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries in which we operate, particularly in\ndeveloping and emerging markets. Refer to the heading “Our Business — Challenges and Risks\"” above and “Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in Part I of this report. As a result,\nmanagement must make numerous assumptions, which involve a significant amount of judgment, when performing recoverability and impairment tests of current and\nnoncurrent assets in various regions around the world.\nWe perform recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For certain assets, recoverability and/or impairment tests are\nrequired only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently\nif events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.\nThe performance of recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets involves critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management\njudgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others,\nthe economic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, the impact of any supply chain disruptions, inflation, long-term\ngrowth rates, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending, proceeds from the sale of assets and customers? financial\ncondition. These factors are even more difficult to estimate as a result of uncertainties associated with the scope, severity and duration of the global COVID-19 pandemic and\nany resurgences of the pandemic, including, but not limited to, the number of people contracting the virus; the impact of shelter-in-place and social distancing requirements; the\nimpact of governmental actions across the globe to contain the virus; vaccine availability, rates of vaccination and effectiveness of vaccines against existing and new variants of\nthe virus; governmental or other vaccine mandates and any associated business and supply chain disruptions; and the substance and pace of the economic recovery. The\nestimates we use when performing recoverability tests of assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the\nfair values of the assets using management's best assumptions, which we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use The variability of these factors\ndepends on a number of conditions, including uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period.\nWhile uncertainties still exist, we expect to see continued improvements in our business as vaccines become more widely available, as vaccination rates increase, and as\nconsumers return to many of their previous work routines as well as socializing and traveling. The Company has certain intangible and other long-lived assets that are more\ndependent on cash flows generated in the away-from-home channels and/or that generate cash flows in geographic areas that are more heavily impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic and are therefore more susceptible to impairment. In addition, intangible and other long-lived assets we acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible\nto impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions at the time of acquisition. If we had used other\nassumptions and estimates when tests of these assets were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future\nperiods, or if different conditions exist in future periods, impairment charges could result. The total future impairment charges we may be required to record could be material.\nRefer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent acquisitions. Refer to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements for the discussion of impairment charges. Refer to the heading “Operations Review? below for additional information related to our present business environment.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investment in Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings Inc. (\"CCBJHI\") exceeded its fair value by $87 million, or 18 percent.\nBased on the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than our carrying value and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time\nsufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, management determined that the decline in fair value was temporary in nature. Therefore, we did not record an\nimpairment charge related to the investment.\nOur equity method investees also perform such recoverability and impairment tests. If an impairment charge is recorded by one of our equity method investees, the Company\nrecords its proportionate share of such charge as a reduction of equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. However, the actual amount we record with\nrespect to our proportionate share of such charge may be impacted by items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains.\nInvestmentsinEquityandDebtSecurities\nWe measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value with the change in fair value included in\nnet income. We use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without readily determinable\nfair values, we have elected the measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from\nobservable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual\nbasis.\nOur investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. The cost basis is determined by the specific identification method. Investments in debt\nsecurities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities\nthat are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading debt\nsecurities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale debt\nsecurities are included in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), except for the changes in fair values attributable to\nthe currency risk being hedged, if applicable, which are included in net income.\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method and debt securities classified as trading are not assessed for\nimpairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. Equity method investments, equity securities without readily determinable\nfair values and debt securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are reviewed each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in\ncircumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to\nour cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. The fair values\nof most of our Company's investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded\ncompanies, management's assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds and appraisals, as\nappropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or\nestimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the\ndetermination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other\nthan temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair\nvalue is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term\nprospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.\nProperty,PlantandEquipment\nCertain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount or remaining useful life of property, plant and equipment should be\nassessed, including, among others, the manner or length of time in which the Company intends to use the asset, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in\nthe business climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses and/or projected future losses. When such events or\nchanges in circumstances are present and a recoverability test is performed, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the aset or asset group and its\neventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and\nwithout interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge\nrecognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment,\nincluding appraisals and discounted cash flow models. These appraisals and models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use.\nGoodwill,TrademarksandOtherIntangibleAssets\nIntangible assets are classified into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to\namortization; and (3) goodwill. For intangible assets with definite lives, recoverability tests must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be\nrecoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, impairment tests must be performed at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances\nindicate that an asset may be impaired.\nThe performance of recoverability and impairment tests of intangible assets involves critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment,\ninclude inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the\neconomic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, the impact of any supply chain disruptions, inflation, long-term growth\nrates, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending, proceeds from the sale of assets and customers? financial condition.\nThese factors are even more difficult to predict when global financial markets are highly volatile. The estimates we use when performing recoverability tests of intangible assets\nare consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions,\nwhich we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. The estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate. The\nvariability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period.\nIf other assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. As mentioned above, these factors do not change in\nisolation and, therefore, we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different\nassumptions in future periods or if different conditions exist in future periods, impairment charges could result. Refer to the heading “Operations Review\" below for additional\ninformation related to our present business environment.\nIntangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and\nmacroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if operating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it\ncould result in the impairment of the acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in\nour cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates.\nAdditionally, we are required to ensure that the assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions that we believe a market\nparticipant would use. As a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of\nwhether our Company's actual cost of capital has changed Therefore, if the cost of capital and/or discount rates change, our Company may recognize an impairment of an\nintangible asset in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts.\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on\ngeographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our geographic operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller\ngeographic regions. These geographic regions are our reporting units. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa, innocent and dogadan\nbusinesses as wellas fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the Company and Monster, each of which is its own reporting unit. The Bottling\nInvestments operating segment includes all of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location. Generally, each consolidated bottling operation within\nour Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each\nbusinesscombination.\nIn order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting\nunit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. However, the impairment\ncharge recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. We typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The\nassumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe a market participant would use. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of\ngoodwill rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying\namount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing discussed above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further\nassessment.\nWhen events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, management performs a recoverability test of the\ncarrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our\ninternal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, we\nrecognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to\ndetermine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models. These models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant\nWwoulduse.\nWe test indefinite-lived intangible assets, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate\nthat an asset may be impaired. Our Company performs these annual impairment tests as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We use a variety of methodologies in\nconducting impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models. These models include assumptions we believe are\nconsistent with those a market participant would use. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment\ncharge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than\ngoodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its\ncarrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any\nfurther assessment.",

        "content": "MacroeconomicandIndustryRisks\nThe Company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and\nadverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial\ncondition,\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales.\nIn addition, the Company's global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company's supplier facilities, including\nmanufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.s. As a result, the Company's operations and performance depend\nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to\ntrade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations\ncan adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company's products\nand services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to financial\nmarket volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values,\nenergy shortages and cost increases, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors.\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company's products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional\neconomic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company's suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers,\ndistributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain\ncredit to finance operations and purchases of the Company's products; and insolvency.\nA downturn in the economic environment can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company's trade\nreceivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company's ability to issue\nnew debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company's financial instruments. These and other economic\nfactors can materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price have been adversely affected and\ncould in thefuture be materially adversely affected by the CoviD-19 pandemic.\nCOViD-19 has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to\ntake unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations\ntemporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COviD-19 pandemic has at times\nsignificantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets.\nThe COviD-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the\nfuture materially adversely impact the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. During the\ncourse of the pandemic, certain of the Company's component suppliers and manufacturing and logistical service providers have\nexperienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide, and similar disruptions could occur in the\nfuture. Public safety measures can also adversely impact consumer demand for the Company's products and services in\naffectedareas.\nThe Company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and\nrequirements of relevant authorities. The extent to which the COviD-19 pandemic may impact the Company's operational and\nfinancial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company's control, including the timing,\nextent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution and\neffectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on\nthe global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include\nmaterial adverse effects on demand for the Company's products and services, the Company's supply chain and sales and\ndistribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\nTo the extent the COviD-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and\nstock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism,\nnatural disasters,public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents\nand other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular\nnetwork carriers and other channel partners.\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales,\nand the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's\nmanufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India,\nJapan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs,\nsanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business,\nparticularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has\nsignificant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being\nimposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the\nCompany's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely\nimpact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive\nfor customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also\nadopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the\nCompany's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These\nmeasures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships,\nand ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company's operations in accordance with new or\nchanged trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can\nbe announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from\nsuch measures. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly\nmore severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade\nand other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely\naffect the Company's business.\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract\nmanufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and\nfacilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial\naccidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health\nissues, including pandemics such as the COviD-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate\nchange is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can\nmake it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and\ninefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service\nofferings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant\nexpenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the\nsupply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any\nnegative consequences to the Company.\nThe Company's operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While\nthe Company's suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur\nand could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company's business, and harm to the Company's reputation.\nMajor public health issues, including pandemics such as the COviD-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the\nfuture materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products;\nthe imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight\nservices and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company's supply chain and sales and\ndistribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to\ncover all losses that may arise.\nGlobal markets for the Company's products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological\nchange, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\nThe Company's products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price\ncompetition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short\nproduct life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid\nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.\nThe Company's ability to compete successfuly depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative\nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the\nCompany must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected\nreturns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to\nregister, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company's competitors seek to compete\nprimarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company's products and infringing on\nits intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the\nCompany operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if\ncompetitors infringe on the Company's intellectual property, the Company's ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be\nmateriallyadverselyaffected.\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces\nsubstantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other\nresources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the\nCompany's competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices.\nCompetition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain\ncompetitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of\nthe markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company's product features and applications\nwithin their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also\nexpects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company's approach to providing components seamlessly within their\nofferings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\nThe Company's services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and\nexperience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models\nthat provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content\nandapplications.\nThe Company's business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially_on the Company's ability to\ncontinually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the\nCompany will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.",

The CoviD-19\npandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COviD-19\npandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company's business, results of\noperations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company's stock.\nDuring 2021, aspects of the Company's business continued to be affected by the COviD-19 pandemic, with many of the Company's retail stores, as well as\nchannel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and a significant number of the Company's employees working remotely. The Company has\nreopened all of its retail stores and substantially all of its other facilities, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of\nemployees and customers, and it continues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its facilities, subject to local rules and regulations. During the fourth\nquarter of 2021, certain of the Company's component suppliers and logistical service providers experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that\naffected sales worldwide. Similar disruptions could occur in the future.\nThe extent of the continuing impact of the COvID-19 pandemic on the Company's operational and financial performance is uncertain and will depend on many\nfactors outside the Company's control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development,\navailability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the\nglobal economy and demand for consumer products.
