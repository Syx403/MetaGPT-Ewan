        "content": "ShippingandHandlingCosts\nShipping and handling costs related to the movement of goods from our manufacturing locations to our sales distribution centers are included in the line item cost of goods sold\nin our consolidated statement of income. Shipping and handling costs incurred to move goods from our manufacturing locations or sales distribution centers to our customers\nare also included in the line itm cost of goods sold in ur consolidated statement of income, xcept for costs incurred todistribute goods sold by ur consolidated botlers to\nour customers, which are included in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. Our customers generally do not pay us\nseparately for shipping and handling costs. We recognize the cost of shipping and handling activities that are performed after a customer obtains control of the goods as costs to\nfulfill our promise to provide goods to the customer. As a result of this election, the Company does not evaluate whether shipping and handling activities are services promised\nto customers. If revenue is recognized for the related goods before the shipping and handling activities occur, the related costs of those shipping and handling activities are\naccrued.\nSales,Use,Value-Added and ExciseTaxes\nThe Company collects taxes imposed directly on its customers related to sales, use, value-added, excise and other similar taxes. The Company then remits such taxes on behalf\nof its customers to the applicable governmental authorities. We exclude from net operating revenues the tax amounts imposed on revenue-producing transactions that were\ncollected from our customers to be remitted to governmental authorities. Accordingly, such tax amounts are recorded in the line item trade accounts receivable in our\nconsolidated balance sheet when collection of taxes from the customer has not yet occurred and are recorded in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our\nconsolidated balance sheet until they are remitted to the applicable governmental authorities. Taxes imposed directly on the Company, whether based on receipts from sales,\ninventory procurement costs or manufacturing activities, are recorded in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income.\nNetIncomePerShare\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company by the weighted-average number of common shares\noutstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net income per share is computed similarly to basic net income per share, except that it includes the potential dilution that\ncould occur if dilutive securities were exercised. We excluded 8 million, 6 million and 6 million stock options from the computation of diluted net income per share in 2022,\n2021 and 2020, respectively, because the stock options would have been antidilutive.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents\nWe classify time deposits and other investments that are highly liquid and have maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase as cash equivalents or restricted cash\nequivalents, as applicable. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents generally consist of amounts held by our captive insurance companies, which are included in the line\nitem other noncurrent asts inour consolidated balance sheet. We manage our exposure to counterpaty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification\nof counterparties and procedures to monitor our concentrations of credit risk.\nstatements of cash flows (in millions):",

        "content": "OURBUSINESS\nGeneral\nThe Coca-Cola Company is a total beverage company, and beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200\ncountries and territories. We own or license and market numerous beverage brands, which we group into the following categories: Trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors;\nwater, sports, coffee and tea; juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages. We own and market five of the world's top six nonalcoholic\nsparkling soft drink brands: Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light.\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and\nretailers as well as the Company's consolidated bottling and distribution operations. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for 2.2 billion of the\nestimated 64 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day\nWe believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of beverage options to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles.\nOur success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day.\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells:\n· beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as *beverage bases,” and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our “concentrate\noperations\"); and\n· finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our “finished product operations\").\nGenerally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.\nOur concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which\nwe typically refer as our “bottlers”? or our “bottling partners\"). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the\nproduct), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and\nrefillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through\nwholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the\nUnited States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing\nbeverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations\nare included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment.\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other fnished beverages to retailers, or to distributors and\nwholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our\nBottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to\ndistributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company's bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments\nor our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa. These sales are included in our Global Ventures\noperating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate\nconsumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our\nNorth America operating segment.\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues attributable to concentrate operations and finished product operations:\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total worldwide unit case volume attributable to concentrate operations and finished product operations:\nWe operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. We face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies. We, along\nwith other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic\nconditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, geopolitical conditions, local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations, fuel prices, weather patterns and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn March 8, 2022, the Company announced the suspension of its business in Russia as a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In addition, the conflict has caused\na disruption of our business in Ukraine. The Company will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve. As a point of reference, in 2021, the\nCompany's business in Russia and Ukraine contributed 2 percent of the Company's unit case volume and 1 percent and 2 percent of the Company's consolidated net operating\nrevenues and operating income, respectively.\nThroughout 2022, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resurgence of the virus in certain countries and the related actions by governments to attempt to contain\nthe spread of the virus, continued to negatively impact our business. While uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic remain, and factors such as the state of the supply\nchain, labor shortages and the inflationary environment are likely to impact the pace of the economic recovery, we are focused on executing for growth.\nDespite the dynamic world in which we are currently operating, we believe we are well positioned to create value for our Company and our stakeholders. In an effort to support\nour future growth, we are continuing to invest in our portfolio of brands, our strategic capabilities and our people. We are focused on the following strategic priorities:\nunlocking the potential of our portfolio of strong global, regional and scaled local brands; developing a robust innovation pipeline focusing on scalable initiatives; increasing\nconsumer-centric marketing effectiveness and efficiency; winning in the marketplace with aligned data-driven revenue growth management and execution capabilities; and\nfurther embedding sustainability goals into our operations.",

Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the\nproduct), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and\nrefillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retalers directly or, in some cases, through\nwholesalers or other botlers. In addition, outside the United States, our botting partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which\nthey sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain\nsyrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment.\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished beverages to retailers, or to distributors and\nwholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our\nBottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to\ndistributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company's bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments\nor our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa. These sales are included in our Global Ventures\noperating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate\nconsumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our\nNorth America operating segment.\nRevenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. Our performance obligation generally consists of the\npromise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling partners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers. Control of the concentrates, syrups or finished products is\ntransferred upon shipment to, or receipt at, our customers? locations, as determined by the specific terms of the contract. Upon transfer of control to the customer, which\ncompletes our performance obligation, revenue is recognized. Our sales terms generally do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing\ndefects on our part. After completion of our performance obligation, we have an unconditional right to consideration as outlined in the contract. Our receivables will generally\nbe collected in less than six months, in accordance with the underlying payment terms. All of our performance obligations under the terms of contracts with our customers have\nan original duration of one year or less.\nOur customers and bottling partners may be entitled to cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume-based incentive programs, support for\ninfrastructure programs and other similar programs. In most markets, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned\nfinancial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers always changing neds and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model.\nUnder this model, the price we charge botlers for concentrates they use to prepare and package finished products is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited\nto, the prices charged by the bottlers for such finished products, the channels in which they are sold, and package mix. The amounts associated with the arrangements described\nabove represent variable consideration, an estimate of which is included in the transaction price as a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statement of\nincome upon completion of our performance obligations. The total revenue recorded, including any variable consideration, cannot exceed the amount for which it is probable\nthat a significant reversal will not occur when uncertainties related to variability are resolved. As a result, we are recognizing revenue based on our faithful depiction of the\nconsideration that we expect to receive. In making our estimates of variable consideration, we consider past results and make significant assumptions related to: (1) customer\nsales volumes; (2) customer ending inventories; (3) customer selling price per unit; (4) selling channels; and (5) discount rates, rebates and other pricing allowances, as\napplicable. In gathering data to estimate our variable consideration, we generally calculate our estimates using a portfolio approach at the country and product line level rather\nthan at the individual contract level. The result of making these estimates will impact the line items trade accounts receivable or accounts payable and accrued expenses in our\nconsolidated balance sheet, as applicable. The actual amounts ultimately paid and/or received may be different from our estimates. The change in the amount of variable\nconsideration recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022 related to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods was immaterial.",

        "content": "2 The increase was primarily related to a change in judgment about the Company's tax positions with several foreign jurisdictions.\n3 The decrease was primarily related to a change in judgment about one of the Company's tax positions that became certain as a result of settlement of a matter in the United States.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the line item income taxes on our consolidated statement of income. The Company had\n$453 million, $391 million and $201 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Of\nthese amounts, expense of $62 million, $190 million and $11 million was recognized in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax\npositions, the reversal of this accrual would be a benefit to the Company's effective tax rate.\nIt is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next 12 months; however, we do not expect any changes will have a significant impact on our\nconsolidated statement of income or consolidated balance sheet. These changes may be the result of settlements of ongoing audits, statute of limitations expiring or final\nsettlements in transfer pricing matters that are the subject of litigation. Currently, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $2,313 million of loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. Loss carryforwards of $849 million must be utilized within\nthe next five years, and the remainder can be utilized over a period greater than five years.\nAn analysis of our deferred tax asset valuation allowances is as follows (in millions):\nThe Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowances are primarily the result of uncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss\ncarryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards from operations in various jurisdictions and basis differences in certain equity investments. Current evidence does not\nsuggest we will realize sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryforward period to allow us to realize these deferred tax benefits. If we were to\nidentify and implement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or generate sufficient income of the appropriate character in these jurisdictions in the future,\nit could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to\nrealize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheet.\nIn 2021, the Company recognized a net decrease of $5 million in its valuation allowances. The decrease was primarily due to net decreases in the deferred tax assets and related\nvaluation allowances on certain equity investments and the changes in net operating losses in the normal course of business.\nIn 2020, the Company recognized a net increase of $103 million in its valuation allowances. The increase was primarily due to net increases in the deferred tax assets and\nrelated valuation allowances on certain equity investments. The increase was also due to the increase of valuation allowances after considering significant negative evidence on\nthe utilization of certain net operating losses and excess foreign tax credits.\nIn 2019, the Company recognized a net decrease of $116 million in its valuation allowances. This decrease was primarily due to the reversal of a valuation allowance after\nconsidering significant positive evidence on the utilization of certain net operating losses. This decrease was also due to the reversal of a valuation allowance in our U.S.\noperations related to expenses that were previously determined to be nondeductible and the changes in net operating losses in the normal course of business. The decrease was\npartially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance due to increases in the deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances on certain equity method investments and\nan increase due to the acquisition of foreign operations.\nNOTE15:OTHERCOMPREHENSIVEINCOME\nAOCI attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company is separately presented in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of The Coca-Cola Company's\nshareowners equity, which also includes our proportionate share of equity method investees' AOCI.

        "content": "OURBUSINESS\nGeneral\nThe Coca-Cola Company is a total beverage company, and beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200\ncountries and territories. We own or license and market numerous beverage brands, which we group into the following categories: Trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors;\nwater, sports, coffee and tea; juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages. We own and market five of the world's top six nonalcoholic\nsparkling soft drink brands: Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light.\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and\nretailers as well as the Company's consolidated bottling and distribution operations. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for 2.2 billion of the\nestimated 64 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day\nWe believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of beverage options to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles.\nOur success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day.\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells:\n· beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as *beverage bases,” and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our “concentrate\noperations\"); and\n· finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our “finished product operations\").\nGenerally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.\nOur concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which\nwe typically refer as our “bottlers”? or our “bottling partners\"). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the\nproduct), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and\nrefillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through\nwholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the\nUnited States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing\nbeverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations\nare included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment.\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other fnished beverages to retailers, or to distributors and\nwholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our\nBottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to\ndistributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company's bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments\nor our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa. These sales are included in our Global Ventures\noperating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate\nconsumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our\nNorth America operating segment.\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues attributable to concentrate operations and finished product operations:\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total worldwide unit case volume attributable to concentrate operations and finished product operations:\nWe operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. We face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies. We, along\nwith other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic\nconditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, geopolitical conditions, local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations, fuel prices, weather patterns and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn March 8, 2022, the Company announced the suspension of its business in Russia as a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In addition, the conflict has caused\na disruption of our business in Ukraine. The Company will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve. As a point of reference, in 2021, the\nCompany's business in Russia and Ukraine contributed 2 percent of the Company's unit case volume and 1 percent and 2 percent of the Company's consolidated net operating\nrevenues and operating income, respectively.\nThroughout 2022, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resurgence of the virus in certain countries and the related actions by governments to attempt to contain\nthe spread of the virus, continued to negatively impact our business. While uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic remain, and factors such as the state of the supply\nchain, labor shortages and the inflationary environment are likely to impact the pace of the economic recovery, we are focused on executing for growth.\nDespite the dynamic world in which we are currently operating, we believe we are well positioned to create value for our Company and our stakeholders. In an effort to support\nour future growth, we are continuing to invest in our portfolio of brands, our strategic capabilities and our people. We are focused on the following strategic priorities:\nunlocking the potential of our portfolio of strong global, regional and scaled local brands; developing a robust innovation pipeline focusing on scalable initiatives; increasing\nconsumer-centric marketing effectiveness and efficiency; winning in the marketplace with aligned data-driven revenue growth management and execution capabilities; and\nfurther embedding sustainability goals into our operations.",

Shipping and handling costs incurred to move goods from our manufacturing locations or sales distribution centers to our customers\nare also included in the line itm cost of goods sold in ur consolidated statement of income, xcept for costs incurred todistribute goods sold by ur consolidated botlers to\nour customers, which are included in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. Our customers generally do not pay us\nseparately for shipping and handling costs. We recognize the cost of shipping and handling activities that are performed after a customer obtains control of the goods as costs to\nfulfill our promise to provide goods to the customer. As a result of this election, the Company does not evaluate whether shipping and handling activities are services promised\nto customers. If revenue is recognized for the related goods before the shipping and handling activities occur, the related costs of those shipping and handling activities are\naccrued.\nSales,Use,Value-Added and ExciseTaxes\nThe Company collects taxes imposed directly on its customers related to sales, use, value-added, excise and other similar taxes. The Company then remits such taxes on behalf\nof its customers to the applicable governmental authorities. We exclude from net operating revenues the tax amounts imposed on revenue-producing transactions that were\ncollected from our customers to be remitted to governmental authorities. Accordingly, such tax amounts are recorded in the line item trade accounts receivable in our\nconsolidated balance sheet when collection of taxes from the customer has not yet occurred and are recorded in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our\nconsolidated balance sheet until they are remitted to the applicable governmental authorities. Taxes imposed directly on the Company, whether based on receipts from sales,\ninventory procurement costs or manufacturing activities, are recorded in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income.\nNetIncomePerShare\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company by the weighted-average number of common shares\noutstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net income per share is computed similarly to basic net income per share, except that it includes the potential dilution that\ncould occur if dilutive securities were exercised. We excluded 8 million, 6 million and 6 million stock options from the computation of diluted net income per share in 2022,\n2021 and 2020, respectively, because the stock options would have been antidilutive.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents\nWe classify time deposits and other investments that are highly liquid and have maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase as cash equivalents or restricted cash\nequivalents, as applicable. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents generally consist of amounts held by our captive insurance companies, which are included in the line\nitem other noncurrent asts inour consolidated balance sheet. We manage our exposure to counterpaty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification\nof counterparties and procedures to monitor our concentrations of credit risk.\nstatements of cash flows (in millions):",

        "content": "1 The increase was primarily related to a change in judgment on certain tax positions due to the Opinion. Refer to Note 1l of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the line item income taxes on our consolidated statement of income. The Company had\n$453 million and $391 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Of these amounts, expense\nof $62 million and $190 million was recognized in 2021 and 2020, respectively. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would\nbe a benefit to the Company's effective tax rate.\nBased on current tax laws, the Company's effective tax rate in 2022 is expected to be approximately 20 percent before considering the potential impact of any significant\noperating and nonoperating items that may affect our effective tax rate.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position\nWe believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of the fundamental strengths of our business. Refer to the heading “Cash Flows from Operating\nActivities” below. The Company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase\nour return on shareowners? equity. Refer to the heading “Cash Flows from Financing Activities\" below. We have a history of borrowing funds both domestically and\ninternationally at reasonable interest rates, and we expect to be able to continue to borrow funds at reasonable rates over the long term. Our debt financing also includes the use\nof a commercial paper program. We currently have the ability to borrow funds in this market at levels that are consistent with our debt financing strategy and expect to continue\nto be able to do so in the future.\nThe Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and, as a result of this review, during 2021 we issued U.S. dollar- and euro-denominated long-\nterm notes of $6.0 billion and E3.2 billion, respectively, across various maturities. We used a portion of the proceeds from these issuances to extinguish certain tranches of our\npreviously issued long-term debt. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these issuances and extinguishments.\nThe Company's cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities totaled $12.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. In addition to these funds, our\ncommercial paper program and our ability to issue long-term debt, we had $8.1 billion in unused backup lines of credit for general corporate purposes as of December 31, 2021.\nThese backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2022 through 2027.\nWhile uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic remain, we expect to continue to see improvements in our business as vaccines become more widely available. The\ntiming and availability of vaccines will be different around the world, and therefore we believe the pace of the recovery will vary by geography depending on vaccine\navailability, rates of vaccination and the effectiveness of vaccines against existing and new variants of the virus, along with other macroeconomic factors. We will remain\nflexible so that we can adjust to uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our current capital allocation priorities are as follows: investing wisely to support our\nbusiness operations, continuing to grow our dividend payment, enhancing our beverage portfolio and capabilities through opportunistic and disciplined acquisitions, and using\nexcess cash to repurchase shares over time. We currently expect 2022 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.5 billion. During 2022, we also expect to repurchase\napproximately $500 million of shares in addition to repurchasing shares equivalent to the proceeds from the issuances of stock under our stock-based compensation plans.\nWe are currently in litigation with the IRS for tax years 2007 through 2009. On November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion in which it predominantly sided with the\nIRS; however, a final decision is still pending and the timing of such decision is not currently known. The Company strongly disagrees with the IRS' positions and the portions\nof the Opinion affrming such positions and intends to vigorously defend our positions uilizing every available avenue of appeal. While the Company believes that i is more\nlikely than not that we will ultimately prevail in this litigation upon appeal, it is possible that all, or some portion of, the adjustments proposed by the IRS and sustained by the\nTax Court could ultimately be upheld. In the event that all of the adjustments proposed by the IRS are ultimately upheld for tax years 2007 through 2009 and the IRS, with the\nconsent of the federal courts, were to decide to apply the Tax Court Methodology to the subsequent years up to and including 2021, the Company currently estimates that the\npotential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $13 billion as of December 31, 2021. Additional income tax and interest would continue to\naccrue until the time any such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. Once the Tax Court renders a final decision, the Company will have 90 days to file a notice\nof appeal and pay the portion of the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which we currently estimate to be\napproximately $4.9 billion (including interest accrued through December 31, 2021), plus any additional interest accrued through the time of payment. Refer to Note 11 of Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the tax litigation.\nWhile we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail in the tax litigation discussed above, we are confident that, between our ability to generate cash flows from\noperating activities and our ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates, we can manage the range of possible outcomes in the final resolution of the matter.\nBased on all of the aforementioned factors, the Company believes its current liquidity position is strong and will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and\ncash commitments for investing and financing activities for the foreseeable future.\nCashFlowsfromOperatingActivities\nAs part of our continued efforts to improve our working capital efficiency, we have worked with our suppliers over the past several years to revisit terms and conditions,\nincluding the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers are 120 days. Additionally, two global financial institutions offer a\nvoluntary supply chain finance (*SCF\") program which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to these\nfinancial institutions on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus may be more beneficial to them. The SCF program is available to suppliers of\ngoods and services included in cost of goods sold as well as suppliers of goods and services included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated\nstatement of income. The Company and our suppliers agree on the contractual terms for the goods and services we procure, including prices, quantities and payment terms,\nregardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the SCF program. The suppliers sell goods or services, as applicable, to the Company and issue the associated invoices\nto the Company based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. Then, if they are participating in the SCF program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which\ninvoices, if any, they want to sell to the financial institutions. Our suppliers? voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms. No\nguarantees are provided by the Company or any of our subsidiaries under the SCF program. We have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate in the SCF\nprogram, and we have ndirect financial relationshp with the financial institutions, asit relates to the CF program.Accordingly,amounts u to our suppliers that elctd t\nparticipate in the SCF program are included in the line itm accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. Allactivity relatd to amounts de to\nsuppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program is reflected within the operating activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. We have been informed\nby the financial institutions that as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, suppliers had elected to sell $882 million and $703 million, respectively, of our outstanding payment\nobligations to the financial institutions. The amounts settled through the SCF program were $3,237 million and $2,810 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and\n2020, respectively. We do not believe there is a risk that our payment terms will be shortened in the near future.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company started a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. Under this program we can elect to sell trade accounts\nreceivables to unaffliated fnancial institutions a a discount. In these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the Company collcts customer payments related t\nthe factored receivables and remits those payments to the financial institutions. The Company sold $6,266 million and $185 million of trade accounts receivables under this\nprogram during the years ended Decmber 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and the costs of factoring such receivables were not material. The cash received from the financial\ninstitutions is classified within the operating activities section in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $12,625 million and $9,844 million, respectively, an increase of $2,781 million,\nor 28 percent. This increase was primarily driven by increased operating income, which includes a benefit from our trade accounts receivable factoring program, a favorable\nimpact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, lower annual incentive payments in 2021 as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operating\nperformance in 2020, lower payments in 2021 of prior year-end marketing accruals due to lower spending in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and lower\nprepayments to customers in 2021. These items were partially ofset by higher payments related to our strategic realignment initiatives along with higher tax payments in 2021.\nCashFlowsfromInvestingActivities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2,765 million and $1,477 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nPurchases of Investments and Proceeds fromDisposals of Investments\nIn 2021, purchases of investments were $6,030 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $7,059 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $1,029 million. In\n2020, purchases of investments were $13,583 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $13,835 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $252 million. This\nactivity primarily represents the purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments in marketable securities and short-term investments that were made as part of the\nCompany's overall cash management strategy. Also included in this activity are purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments held by our captive insurance\ncompanies.\nAcquisitions of Businesses,EquityMethod Investments and NonmarketableSecurities\nIn 2021, the Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $4,766 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of\nthe remaining ownership interest in BodyArmor.\nIn 2020, the Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $1,052 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of\nthe remaining ownership interest in fairlife.\nRefer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions.\nProceeds fromDisposals ofBusinesses,Equity Method Investments and NonmarketableSecurities\nIn 2021, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities were $2,180 million, which primarily related to the sale of our\nownership interest in CCA, an equity method investee, to CCEP, also an equity method investee.\nIn 2020, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities were $189 million, which primarily related to the sale of our\nownership interest in Piedmont Coca-Cola Bottling Partnership to Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., an equity method investee.\nRefer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our disposals.\nPurchasesofProperty,PlantandEquipment\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $1,367 million and $1,177 million, respectively\nTotal capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and the percentage of such totals by operating segment and Corporate were as follows (in millions):\nCashFlowsfromFinancingActivities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $6,786 million and $8,070 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively\nDebt Financing\nOur Company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our\noverall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners? equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our\ncredit ratings.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our long-term debt was rated “A+\" by Standard & Poor's and “A1\" by Moody's. Our commercial paper program was rated “A-1\" by Standard &\nPoor's and *p-1 by Moody's. In assessing our credit strength, both rating agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and\nfinancial policies as well as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, certain rating agencies also consider the financial\ninformation of certain bottlers, including CCEP, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation for the\ndebt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company's business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep\nthese bottlers viable. It is our expectation that these rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in\nour capital structure, our major bottlers? financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our\ncost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers credit ratings were to decline, the Company's equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential\nincrease in interest expense for those bottlers.\nWe monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different\naggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our\nCompany.\nOur global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to borrow funds at a low effective cost. This posture,\ncoupled with active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt as well as our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of\nborrowing. Our debt management policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase program and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets.\nIssuances and payments of debt included both short-term and long-term financing activities. During 2021, the Company had issuances of debt of $13,094 million, which\nincluded $3,391 million of issuances related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and $80 million of net issuances related to\ncommercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less. The Company's total long-term debt issuances were $9,623 million, net of related discounts and\nissuancecosts.\nDuring 2021, the Company made payments of debt of $12,866 million, which consisted of $2,357 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with\nmaturities greater than 90 days and payments of long-term debt of $10,509 million.\nDuring 2020, the Company had issuances of debt of $26,934 million, which included $8,260 million of issuances related to commercial paper and short-term debt with\nmaturities greater than 90 days and long-term debt issuances of $18,674 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs.\nDuring 2020, the Company made payments of debt of $28,796 million, which included $15,292 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with\nmaturities greater than 90 days and $1,768 million net issuances related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less. The Company's total\npayments of long-term debt were $11,736 million.\nOn December 31, 2021, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, the governing body responsible for regulating LIBOR, ceased to publish certain LIBOR reference\nrates. However, other LIBOR reference rates, including U.S. dollar overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month maturities will continue to be published through June\n2023. In preparation for the discontinuation of LIBOR, wehave amended, or willamend, our LOR-referencing agreements to either reference the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate or include mechanics for selecting an alternative rate. We do not plan to enter into variable-rate agreements that reference LIOR after Decmber 31, 2021.\nIssuancesofStock\nThe issuances of stock in 2021 and 2020 were related to the exercise of stock options by Company employees.\nShareRepurchases\nIn 2012, the Board ofDirectors authorized a share repurchase plan ofup to 500 millon shares of the Company's common stock. In 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a\nnew plan for the Company to purchase up to an additional 150 million shares of our common stock\nDuring 2021 and 2020, the Company did not repurchase common stock under the share repurchase plan authorized by our Board of Directors. Since the inception of our share\nrepurchase program in 1984, we have purchased 3.5 billion shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $17.25. In addition to shares repurchased under the\nshare repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors, the Company's treasury stock activity also includes shares surrendered to the Company to pay the exercise\nprice and/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so-called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and/or the vesting of restricted stock issued to\nemployees. The Company's treasury stock activity during 2021 resulted in a cash outflow of $111 million.\nDividends\nThe Company paid dividends of $7,252 million and $7,047 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAt its February 2022 meeting, our Board of Directors increased our regular quarterly dividend to $0.44 per share, equivalent to a full year dividend of $1.76 per share in 2022.\nThis is our 60th consecutive annual increase. Our annualized common stock dividend was $1.68 per share and $1.64 per share in 2021 and 2020, respectively.",

Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion regarding the Company's 2015 litigation with the IRS involving transfer pricing tax adjustments in which the court\npredominantly sided with the IRS. The Company disagrees with the Opinion and intends to vigorously defend its position. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $926 million. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would\nbe a benefit of $617 million, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties. The remaining $309 million primarily represents tax benefits that would be received in\ndifferent tax jurisdictions in the event the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions.\nA reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the line item income taxes in our consolidated statement of income. The Company had\n$496 million and $453 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of these amounts, expense\nof $43 million and $62million was recognized in 2022 and 2021, respectively. If the Company were to prevail on alluncertain tax positions, the reversal of this acrual woud\nbe a benefit to the Company's effective tax rate.\nBased on current tax laws, the Company's effective tax rate in 2023 is expected to be approximately 19.5 percent before considering the potential impact of any significant\noperating and nonoperating items that may affect our effective tax rate.\nLIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND FINANCIAL POSITION\nWe believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of the fundamental strengths of our business. Refer to the heading “Cash Flows from Operating\nActivities\" below. The Company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase\nour return on shareowners? equity. Refer to the heading “Cash Flows from Financing Activities\"? below. We have a history of borrowing funds both domestically and\ninternationally at reasonable interest rates, and we expect to be able to continue to borrow funds at reasonable rates over the long term. Our debt financing also includes the use\nof a commercial paper program. We currently have the ability to borrow funds in this market at levels that are consistent with our debt financing strategy, and we expect to\ncontinue to be able to do so in the future. The Company regularly reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt.\nThe Company's cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities totaled $11.6 billion as of December 31, 2022. In addition to these funds, our\ncommercial paper program and our ability to issue long-term debt, we had $4.4 billion in unused backup lines of credit for general corporate purposes as of December 31, 2022.\nThese backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2023 through 2028.\nOur current capital allocation priorities are as follows: investing wisely to support our business operations, continuing to grow our dividend payment, enhancing our beverage\nportfolio and capabilities through consumer-centric acquisitions, and using excess cash to repurchase shares over time. We currently expect 2023 capital expenditures to be\napproximately $1.9 billion. During 2023, we also expect to repurchase shares to offset dilution resulting from employee stock-based compensation plans.\nWe are currently in litigation with the IRS for tax years 2007 through 2009. On November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion in which it predominantly sided with the\nIRS; however, a final decision is still pending and the timing of such decision is not currently known. The Company strongly disagrees with the IRS' positions and the portions\nof the Opinion affrming such positions and intends to vigorously defend our positions utilizing every available avenue of appeal. While the Company believes that it is more\nlikely than not that we will ultimately prevail in this litigation upon appeal, it is possible that all, or some portion of, the adjustments proposed by the IRS and sustained by the\nTax Court could ultimately be upheld. In the event that all of the adjustments proposed by the IRS were ultimately upheld for tax years 2007 through 2009 and the IRS, with the\nconsent of the federal courts, were to decide to apply the Tax Court Methodology to the subsequent years up to and including 2022, the Company currently estimates that the\npotential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $14 billion as of December 31, 2022. Additional income tax and interest would continue to\naccrue until the time any such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. Once the Tax Court renders a final decision, the Company will have 90 days to file a notice\nof appeal and pay the portion of the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which we currently estimate to be\napproximately $5.2 billion (including interest accrued through December 31, 2022), plus any additional interest accrued through the time of payment. Refer to Note 11 of Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the tax litigation.\nWhile we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail in the tax litigation discussed above, we are confident that, between our ability to generate cash flows from\noperating activities and our ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates, we can manage the range of possible outcomes in the final resolution of the matter.\nBased on all of the aforementioned factors, the Company believes its current liquidity position is strong and will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and\ncash commitments for investing and financing activities for the foreseeable future.\nCashFlowsfromOperatingActivities\nAs part of our continued efforts to improve our working capital efficiency, we have worked with our suppliers over the past several years to revisit terms and conditions,\nincluding the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers are 120 days. Additionally, two global financial institutions offer a\nvoluntary supply chain finance (SCF\") program which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to selltheir receivables from the Company to these financial institutions\non a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus may be more beneficial to them. The SCF program is available to suppliers of goods and services\nincluded in cost of goods sold as well as suppliers of goods and services included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. The\nCompany and our suppliers agree on contractual terms for the goods and services we procure,including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier\nelects to participate in the SCF program. The suppliers sell goods or services, as applicable, to the Company and issue the associated invoices to the Company based on the\nagreed-upon contractual terms. Then, if they are participating in the SCF program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which invoices, if any, they want to sell to\nthe financial institutions. Our suppliers′ voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms. No guarantees are provided by the Company\nor any of our subsidiaries under the SCF program. We have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate in the SCF program, and we have no direct financial\nrelationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to the SCF program. Accordingly, amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program are\nincluded in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. All activity related to amounts due to suppliers that elected to participate in\nthe SCF program is reflected within the operating activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. We have been informed by the financial institutions that as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, suppliers had elected to sell $1,234 million and $882 million, respectively, of our outstanding payment obligations to the financial institutions.\nThe amounts settled through the SCF program were $4,724 million and $3,237 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We do not believe\nthere is a risk that our payment terms will be shortened in the near future.\nThe Company has a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. Under this program, we can elect to sell trade accounts receivables to unaffiliated financial\ninstitutions at a discount. In these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the Company collects customer payments related to the factored receivables and remits\nthose payments to the financial institutions. The Company sold $10,709 million and $6,266 million of trade accounts receivables under this program during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The costs of factoring such receivables were $27 million and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. The cash received from the financial institutions is classified within the operating activities section in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $11,018 million and $12,625 million, respectively, a decrease of $1,607 million,\nor 13 percent. This decrease was primarily driven by higher marketing payments resulting from 2021 year-end accruals, an unfavorable impact due to foreign currency\nexchange rate fluctuations, the buildup of inventory to manage potential supply chain disruptions, and higher annual incentive and tax payments in 2022. These items were\npartially offset by increased operating income, lower payments related to our strategic realignment initiatives, and increased benefits from the extension of certain vendor\npayment terms and our trade accounts receivable factoring program.\nCashFlowsfromInvestingActivities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $763 million and $2,765 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nPurchases of Investments andProceedsfromDisposals of Investments\nIn 2022, purchases of investments were $3,751 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $4,771 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $1,020 million. In\n2021, purchases of investments were $6,030 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $7,059 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $1,029 million. This\nactivity primarily represents the purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments in marketable securities and short-term investments that were made as part of the\nCompany's overall cash management strategy. Also included in this activity are purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments held by our captive insurance\ncompanies.\nAcquisitions ofBusinesses,EquityMethod Investments andNonmarketableSecurities\nIn 2022, the Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $73 million.\nIn 2021, the Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $4,766 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of\nthe remaining ownership interest in BodyArmor.\nRefer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions.\nProceeds from Disposals of Businesses,Equity Method Investments andNonmarketableSecurities\nIn 2022, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $458 million, which primarily related to the refranchising of\nour bottling operations in Cambodia and the sale of our ownership interest in one of our equity method investments.\nIn 2021, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $2,180 million, which primarily related to the sale of our\nownership interest in CCA, an equity method investe, to CCEP, also an equity method investe.\nRefer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our disposals.\nPurchasesofProperty,Plant andEquipment\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $1,484 million and $1,367 million, respectively.\nCollateral paid associated with our hedging activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 was $1,465 million. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements for additional information on our hedging activities.\nOtherInvestingActivities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total cash inflow for other investing activities was $706 million and $51 million, respectively. The activities during\n2022 included cash proceeds of $823 million received in advance of the refranchising of our bottling operations in Vietnam. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements for additional information on this transaction.\nCashFlowsfromFinancingActivities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $10,250 million and $6,786 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nDebt Financing\nOur Company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our\noverall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners? equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our\ncredit ratings.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our long-term debt was rated “A+”\" by Standard & Poor's and “A1\" by Moody's. Our commercial paper program was rated “A-1”\" by Standard &\nPoor's and “P-1”\" by Moody's. In assessing our credit strength, both rating agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and\nfinancial policies as well as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, certain rating agencies also consider the financial\ninformation of certain bottlers, including CCEP, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation for the\ndebt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company's business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep\nthese bottlers viable. It is our expectation that these rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in\nour capital structure, our major bottlers^ financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies? methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our\ncost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers credit ratings were to decline, the Company's equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential\nincreaseininterest expensefor thosebottlers.\nWe monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different\naggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our\nCompany.\nOur global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to borrow funds at a low effective cost. This posture,\ncoupled with active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt as well as our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of\nborrowing. Our debt management policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase program and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets.\nIssuances and payments of debt included both short-term and long-term financing activities. During 2022, the Company had issuances of debt of $3,972 million, which\nincluded $2,321 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days, $798 million of net issuances of commercial paper and\nshort-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less, and long-term debt issuances of $853 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs.\nDuring 2022, the Company made payments of debt of $4,930 million, which consisted of $3,623 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with\nmaturities greater than 90 days and payments of long-term debt of $1,307 million.\nDuring 2021, the Company had issuances of debt of $13,094 million, which included $3,391 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities\ngreater than 90 days, $80 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less and long-term debt issuances of $9,623 million,\nnet of related discounts and issuance costs.\nDuring 2021, the Company made payments of debt of $12,866 million, which consisted of $2,357 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with\nmaturities greater than 90 days and payments of long-term debt of $10,509 million.\nOn December 31, 2021, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, the governing body responsible for regulating LIBOR, ceased to publish certain LIBOR reference\nrates. However, other LIBOR reference rates, including U.S. dollar overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month maturities, will continue to be published through June\n2023. In preparation for the discontinuation of LIBOR, we have amended, or will amend, our LIBOR-referencing agreements to either reference the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate or include mechanics for selecting an alternative rate. We do not plan to enter into variable-rate agreements that reference LIBOR in the future.\nIssuancesofStock\nThe issuances of stock in 2022 and 2021 were related to the exercise of stock options by employees.\nShareRepurchases\nIn 2012, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan of up to 500 million shares (*2012 Plan\") of the Company's common stock. In May 2022, the Company\nreached the maximum number of shares that could be repurchased under the 2012 Plan and thereby completed the plan. In 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a new share\nrepurchase plan of up to 150 million shares of the Company's common stock.\nDuring 2022, the total cash outflow for treasury stock purchases was $1,418 million. The Company repurchased 21.3 million shares of common stock under the share\nrepurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors. These shares were repurchased at an average price per share of $62.67, for a total cost of $1,336 million. Since the\ninception of our share repurchase program in 1984, we have repurchased 3.5 billion shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $17.53. In addition to shares\nrepurchased under the share repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors, the Company's treasury stock activity also includes shares surrendered to the Company to\npay the exercise price and/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so-called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and/or the vesting of restricted\nstock issued to employees. The net impact of the Company's issuances of stock and share repurchases during 2022 resulted in a net cash outflow of $581 million.\nDuring 2021, the Company did not repurchase shares of our common stock under the share repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors.\nDividends\nThe Company paid dividends of $7,616 million and $7,252 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAt its February 2023 meeting, our Board of Directors increased our regular quarterly dividend to $0.46 per share, equivalent to a full year dividend of $1.84 per share in 20231\nThis is our 61st consecutive annual increase. Our annualized common stock dividend was $1.76 per share and $1.68 per share in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOtherFinancingActivities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total cash outflow for other financing activities was $1,095 million and $353 million, respectively. The activities\nduring 2022 included payments totaling $637 million related to the BodyArmor acquisition, which included amounts originally held back for indemnification obligations.\nAdditionally, other financing activities during 2022 and 2021 included repayments of collateral related to our hedging programs.\n55\nRefer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding loans and notes payable. Upon payment of outstanding commercial paper, we typically issue\nnew commercial paper. Lines of credit and other short-term borrowings are expected to fluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs, especially at international subsidiaries.",

The shares of common stock to be issued and/or sold upon the exercise of stock options are made available\nfrom either authorized and unissued common stock or from treasury shares. Since 2007, the Company has issued common stock under its stock-based compensation plans from\ntreasury shares.\nStock option activity during the year ended December 31, 2022 was as follows:\nThe total intrinsic value of the stock options exercised was $534 million, $358 million and $453 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total number of stock options\nexercised was 22 million, 19 million and 23 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nPerformance-BasedShareUnitAwards\nPerformance share unit awards require achievement of certain performance criteria, which are predefined by the Talent and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors\nat the time of grant. For performance share unit awards granted from 2015 through 2017, the performance criteria were economic profit and net operating revenues over a\npredefined performance period of three years. Economic profit is our net operating profit after tax less the cost of the capital used in our business. Economic profit and net\noperating revenues were adjusted for certain items, which were approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The purpose of these adjustments was to ensure a\nconsistent year-to-year comparison of the specific performance criteria. Most of these awards included a relative TSR modifier to determine the final number of performance\nshare units earned. For these awards, the number of performance share units earned based on the certified achievement of the predefined\n93\nperformance criteria was reduced or increased if the Company's total shareowner return over the performance period relative to a predefined compensation comparator group of\ncompanies fell outside of a predefined range. The fair value of these performance share units was determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The performance share unit\nawards granted from 2015 through 2017 were subject to a one-year holding period after the performance period before the shares were released.\nFor performance share unit awards granted from 2018 through 2022, the performance criteria were equally weighted among net operating revenues, earnings per share and free\ncash flow over a predefined performance period of three years. For performance share unit awards granted to executives in 2022, the performance criteria were weighted 30\npercent for net operating revenues, 30 percent for earnings per share, 30 percent for free cash flow and 10 percent for environmental sustainability. For purposes of these\nperformance criteria, earnings per share is diluted net income per share; free cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and\nequipment; and environmental sustainability is comprised of predefined goals related to the Company's packaging and water security strategies. These performance criteria are\nadjusted for certain items, if applicable, which are subject to Audit Committee approval. The purpose of these adjustments is to ensure a consistent year-to-year comparison of\nthe specific performance criteria. Performance share unit awards granted to executives include a relative TSR modifier to determine the final number of performance share units\nearned. The fair value of performance share units that include a TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. For these awards, the number of\nperformance share units earned based on the certified achievement of the predefined performance criteria will be reduced or increased if the Company's total shareowner return\nover the performance period relative to a predefined compensation comparator group of companies falls outside of a predefined range. The fair value of performance share units\nthat do not include a TSR modifier is the closing market price per share of the Company's stock on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not received\nduring the performance period. The performance share unit awards will generally vest at the end of the respective performance period.\nDuring 2021, in addition to granting performance share unit awards with a three-year performance period, the Company granted emerging stronger performance share unit\nawards with a predefined performance period of two years. The award's performance criterion was earnings per share, and the award included a relative TSR modifier. Earnings\nper share for these purposes was diluted net income per share adjusted for certain items, which were approved by the Audit Committee. The purpose of these adjustments was\nto ensure a consistent year-to-year comparison of the performance criterion. These performance share unit awards generally vested at the end of the two-year performance\nperiod.\nFor performance share unit awards, in the event the certified results equal the predefined performance criteria, the number of performance share units earned will be equal to\nthe target award. In the event the certified results exceed the predefined performance criteria, additional performance share units up to the maximum award will be earned. In\nthe event the certified results fall below the predefined performance criteria but are at or above the minimum threshold, a reduced number of performance share units will be\nearned. If the certified results fall below the minimum threshold, no performance share units will be earned. Performance share unit awards do not entitle participants to vote or\nreceive dividends until the performance share units are settled in stock.\nIn the reporting period it becomes probable that the minimum performance threshold specified in the performance share unit award will be achieved, we recognize\ncompensation expense for the proportionate share of the total fair value of the performance share units related to the vesting period that has already lapsed for the performance\nshare units expected to vest. The remaining fair value of the performance share units expected to vest is expensed on a straight-line basis over the remainder of the vesting\nperiod. In the event the Company determines it is no longer probable that the minimum performance threshold specified in the award will be achieved, we reverse all previously\nrecognized compensation expense in the reporting period such a determination is made.\nPerformance share units earned are generally settled in stock, except for certain circumstances such as death or disability, in which case beneficiaries or employees are provided\ncash payments. As of December 31, 2022, nonvested performance share units of approximately 1,949,000 and 1,757,000 were outstanding for the 2021-2023 and 2022-2024\nperformance periods, respectively, based on the target award amounts.\nWeighted-Average\n1Represents the target level of performance share units vested as of December 31, 2022 for the 2020-2022 and 2021-2022 performance periods. Upon certification in February 2023 of the\nfinancial results for the performance periods, the final number of shares earned will be determined and released.",

Shipping and handling costs incurred to move goods from our manufacturing locations or sales distribution centers to our customers\nare also included in the line itm cost of goods sold in ur consolidated statement of income, xcept for costs incurred todistribute goods sold by ur consolidated botlers to\nour customers, which are included in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. Our customers generally do not pay us\nseparately for shipping and handling costs. We recognize the cost of shipping and handling activities that are performed after a customer obtains control of the goods as costs to\nfulfill our promise to provide goods to the customer. As a result of this election, the Company does not evaluate whether shipping and handling activities are services promised\nto customers. If revenue is recognized for the related goods before the shipping and handling activities occur, the related costs of those shipping and handling activities are\naccrued.\nSales,Use,Value-Added and ExciseTaxes\nThe Company collects taxes imposed directly on its customers related to sales, use, value-added, excise and other similar taxes. The Company then remits such taxes on behalf\nof its customers to the applicable governmental authorities. We exclude from net operating revenues the tax amounts imposed on revenue-producing transactions that were\ncollected from our customers to be remitted to governmental authorities. Accordingly, such tax amounts are recorded in the line item trade accounts receivable in our\nconsolidated balance sheet when collection of taxes from the customer has not yet occurred and are recorded in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our\nconsolidated balance sheet until they are remitted to the applicable governmental authorities. Taxes imposed directly on the Company, whether based on receipts from sales,\ninventory procurement costs or manufacturing activities, are recorded in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income.\nNetIncomePerShare\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company by the weighted-average number of common shares\noutstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net income per share is computed similarly to basic net income per share, except that it includes the potential dilution that\ncould occur if dilutive securities were exercised. We excluded 8 million, 6 million and 6 million stock options from the computation of diluted net income per share in 2022,\n2021 and 2020, respectively, because the stock options would have been antidilutive.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents\nWe classify time deposits and other investments that are highly liquid and have maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase as cash equivalents or restricted cash\nequivalents, as applicable. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents generally consist of amounts held by our captive insurance companies, which are included in the line\nitem other noncurrent asts inour consolidated balance sheet. We manage our exposure to counterpaty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification\nof counterparties and procedures to monitor our concentrations of credit risk.\nstatements of cash flows (in millions):",

        "content": "RiskManagementPrograms\nThe Company has numerous global insurance programs in place to help protect the Company from the risk of loss. In general, we are self-insured for large portions of many\ndifferent types of claims; however, we do use commercial insurance above our self-insured retentions to reduce the Company's risk of catastrophic loss. Our reserves for the\nCompany's self-insured losses are estimated using actuarial methods and assumptions of the insurance industry, adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claims\nhistory. Our self-insurance reserves totaled $199 million and $229 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNOTE12:STOCK-BASEDCOMPENSATIONPLANS\nOur Company grants long-term equity awards under its stock-based compensation plans to certain employees of the Company. The Coca-Cola Company 2014 Equity Plan\n(\"2014 Equity Plan\") was approved by shareowners in April 2014. Under the 2014 Equity Plan, a maximum of 500 million shares of our common stock was approved to be\nissued through the grant of equity awards. The 2014 Equity Plan allows for grants of stock options, performance share units, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other\nspecified award types, including cash awards with performance-based vesting criteria. As of December 31, 2022, there were 308 million shares available to be granted under\nthe 2014 Equity Plan. In addition, there were 3 million shares available for stock option and restricted stock award grants under plans approved by shareowners prior to 2014.\nFrom 2015 to 2017, certain employees who had previously been eligible for long-term equity awards received long-term performance-based cash awards. Employees who\nreceived these performance-based cash awards did not receive equity awards as part of the long-term incentive program. In 2017, the Company changed the long-term incentive\nprogram for employees previously eligible for the performance-based cash award. These employees no longer participate in the long-term incentive program and were granted a\nfinal restricted stock unit award that vests ratably over five years.\nTotal stock-based compensation expense was $361 million, $337 million and $141 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2022, for certain employees who accepted\nvoluntary separation from the Company as a result of the restructuring of our North America operating unit, the Company provided cash payments designed to offset the loss of\ncertain equity awards and serve as a cash supplement to employees upon the exercise of certain stock options. In 2020, for certain employees who accepted voluntary separation\nfrom the Company as a result of our strategic realignment initiatives, the Company modified their outstanding equity awards so that the employees retained all or some of their\nawards, whereas otherwise the awards would have been forfeited. The incremental stock-based compensation expense in 2022 arising from the cash payments was $5 million,\nand the incremental stock-based compensation expense in 2020 arising from the modification of awards was $15 million. These amounts were recorded in the line item other\noperating charges in our consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 18 for additional information on the Company's restructuring and strategic realignment initiatives.\nThe remainder of stock-based compensation expense in 2022 and 2020 of $356 million and $126 million, respectively, and all stock-based compensation expense in 2021 were\nrecorded in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income. The total income tax benefit recognized in our consolidated\nstatements of income related to total stock-based compensation expense was $55 million, $60 million and $32 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $325 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based compensation awards granted under our plans, which\nwe expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years as stock-based compensation expense. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-\nbased compensation awards.",

We own or license and market numerous beverage brands, which we group into the following categories: Trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors;\nwater, sports, coffee and tea; juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages. We own and market five of the world's top six nonalcoholic\nsparkling soft drink brands: Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light.\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and\nretailers as well as the Company's consolidated bottling and distribution operations. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for 2.2 billion of the\nestimated 64 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day\nWe believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of beverage options to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles.\nOur success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day.\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells:\n· beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as *beverage bases,” and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our “concentrate\noperations\"); and\n· finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our “finished product operations\").\nGenerally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.\nOur concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which\nwe typically refer as our “bottlers”? or our “bottling partners\"). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the\nproduct), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and\nrefillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through\nwholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the\nUnited States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing\nbeverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations\nare included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment.\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other fnished beverages to retailers, or to distributors and\nwholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our\nBottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to\ndistributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company's bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments\nor our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa. These sales are included in our Global Ventures\noperating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate\nconsumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our\nNorth America operating segment.\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues attributable to concentrate operations and finished product operations:\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total worldwide unit case volume attributable to concentrate operations and finished product operations:\nWe operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. We face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies. We, along\nwith other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic\nconditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, geopolitical conditions, local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations, fuel prices, weather patterns and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn March 8, 2022, the Company announced the suspension of its business in Russia as a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In addition, the conflict has caused\na disruption of our business in Ukraine. The Company will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve. As a point of reference, in 2021, the\nCompany's business in Russia and Ukraine contributed 2 percent of the Company's unit case volume and 1 percent and 2 percent of the Company's consolidated net operating\nrevenues and operating income, respectively.\nThroughout 2022, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resurgence of the virus in certain countries and the related actions by governments to attempt to contain\nthe spread of the virus, continued to negatively impact our business. While uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic remain, and factors such as the state of the supply\nchain, labor shortages and the inflationary environment are likely to impact the pace of the economic recovery, we are focused on executing for growth.\nDespite the dynamic world in which we are currently operating, we believe we are well positioned to create value for our Company and our stakeholders. In an effort to support\nour future growth, we are continuing to invest in our portfolio of brands, our strategic capabilities and our people. We are focused on the following strategic priorities:\nunlocking the potential of our portfolio of strong global, regional and scaled local brands; developing a robust innovation pipeline focusing on scalable initiatives; increasing\nconsumer-centric marketing effectiveness and efficiency; winning in the marketplace with aligned data-driven revenue growth management and execution capabilities; and\nfurther embedding sustainability goals into our operations.",

Likewise, when we use the capitalized word “Trademark” together with the name of one of our other beverage products (such as “Trademark Fanta,\"\n\"Trademark Sprite” or “Trademark Simply\"), we mean beverages bearing the indicated trademark (that is, Fanta, Sprite or Simply, respectively) and all its variations and\nline extensions (such that “Trademark Fanta” includes Fanta Orange, Fanta Zero Orange, Fanta Zero Sugar, Fanta Apple, etc.; “Trademark Sprite” includes Sprite, Sprite\nZero Sugar, etc.; and \"Trademark Simply”' includes Simply Orange, Simply Apple, Simply Grapefruit, etc.).\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells:\n· beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as “beverage bases,” and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our “concentrate\noperations\"); and\n· finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our “finished product operations\").\nGenerally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.\nOur concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which\nwe typically refer as our “bottlers” or our *\"bottling partners\"). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the\nproduct), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and\nrefillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through\nwholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which\nthey sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain\nsyrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment.\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished beverages to retailers or to distributors and\nwholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our\nBottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to\ndistributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company's bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments\nor our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa Limited (*\"Costa\"). These sales are included in our\nGlobal Ventures operating segmet.

        "content": "RISKSRELATEDTOOUROPERATIONS\nThe CoVID-19 pandemic and related ongoing impacts may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the related actions by governments around the world to attempt to contain the spread of the virus have negatively impacted, and could continue\nto negatively impact, our business globally. Our recovery has been asynchronous and the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will affect our results of operations,\nfinancial condition and cash flows will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, among others, new information which may\nemerge concerning the pandemic, vaccine adoption rates (including boosters) and the effectiveness of vaccines in limiting or stopping the spread of COVID-19, either over the\nlong term or against new, emerging variants of COVID-19, and any related actions by governments.\nThe extent and nature of government actions related to the COVID-19 pandemic varied throughout 2020 and 2021 based upon the then-current extent and severity of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic within the respective markets. At times we experienced a decrease in sales of certain of our products in markets around the world, including consumer\ndemand shifting to more at-home consumption versus away-from-home consumption. While in 2021 we have experienced improved trends in away-from-home channels and\nimproved margins, if COVID-19 infection rates increase, the pandemic intensifies or expands geographically, or continued efforts to curb the pandemic are ineffective, the\nnegative impacts of the pandemic on our sales could be more prolonged and may become more severe than we are currently experiencing. In addition, continuing economic and\npolitical uncertainties, such as increased unemployment, decreases in disposable income, declines in consumer confidence, or economic slowdowns or recessions in any of our\nmajor markets, may slow down or prevent the recovery of the demand for our products or may erode such demand.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and could continue to disrupt our global supply chain. We and our bottling partners have experienced temporary disruptions in certain\nof our operations; delays in delivery of concentrates, ingredients, packaging and equipment; temporary plant closures; production slowdowns; and difficulty or delays in\nsourcing key ingredients and beverage containers. We and our bottling partners may face similar disruptions in the future, which may increase supply chain and packaging\ncosts, or may result in an inability to secure key ingredients and inputs, which could cause delays in delivering our products to our customers and consumers. Although we are\nunable to predict the impact on our ability to source materials in the future, we expect supply chain pressures to continue into 2022.\nIn addition to the above risks, the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate other risks related to our business, including risks related to changes in the retail landscape or the loss\nof key retail or foodservice customers; fluctuations in input costs, inflation rates, and foreign currency exchange rates; and the ability of third-party service providers and\nbusiness partners to fulfil their\nrespective commitments and responsibilities to us in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreed-upon terms. The continuing evolution of the pandemic may also\npresent risks not currently known to us.\nIncreasedcompetitioncouldhurtourbusiness.\nWe operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. For additional information regarding the competitive environment in which we operate, including the\nnames of certain of our significant competitors, refer to the heading “Competition”? set forth in Part I, “Item 1. Busines”? of this report. Our ability to maintain or gain share of\nsales in the global market or in local markets may be limited as a result of actions by competitors. Competitive pressures may cause the Company and our bottling partners to\nreduce prices we charge customers or may restrict our and our bottlers? ability to increase prices, as may be necessary in response to commodity and other cost increases. Such\npressures may also increase marketing costs along with in-store placement and slotting fees. In addition, the rapid growth of e-commerce may create additional consumer price\ndeflation by, among other things, facilitating comparison shopping, and could potentially threaten the value of some of our legacy route-tomarket strategies and thus negatively\naffect revenues. If we do not continuously strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation to maintain consumer interest, brand loyalty and market share while we\nselectively expand into other profitable categories in the commercial beverage industry, our business could be negatively affected.\nIf we are not successful in our innovation activities, our financial results may be negatively affected.\nAchieving our business growth objectives depends in part on our ability to evolve and improve our existing beverage products through innovation and to successfully develop,\nintroduce and market new beverage products. The success of our innovation activities depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and\ntrends; obtain, maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections; and avoid infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. If we are not successful in our\ninnovation activities, we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives, which may have a negative impact on our financial results.\nChanges in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail or foodservice customers could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in, and the blurring of the lines between, retail channels, particularly in Europe and the United States. Larger\nretailers may seek lower prices from us and our bottling partners, may demand increased marketing or promotional expenditures, and may be more likely to use their\ndistribution networks to introduce and develop private-label brands, any of which could negatively affect the Coca-Cola system's profitability. In addition, in developed markets\ndiscounters and value stores are growing at a rapid pace, while in emerging and developing markets modern trade is growing at a faster pace than traditional trade outlets. Our\nindustry is also being affected by the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce retailers, e-commerce websites, mobile commerce applications and subscription services, which\nmay result in a shift away from physical retail operations to digital channels. As we and our bottling partners build e-commerce capabilities, we may not be able to develop and\nmaintain successful relationships with existing and new e-commerce retailers without experiencing a deterioration of our relationships with key customers operating physical\nretail channels. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape, including the rapid growth in digital commerce, our share of sales, volume\ngrowth and overallfinancial results could be negatively affected. In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships with key retail and\nfoodservice customers. The loss of one or more of our key retail or foodservice customers could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nIf we are unable to expand our operations in emerging and developing markets, our growth rate could be negatively affected.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in emerging and developing markets, which in turn depends on economic and political conditions in those\nmarkets and on our ability to work with local bottlers to make necesary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities, distribution networks, sales equipment and\ntechnology. Additionally, we rely on local availability of talented management and employees to establish and manage our operations in these markets. Scarcity of, or heavy\ncompetition for, talented employee resources could impede our abilities in such markets. Moreover, the supply of our products in emerging and developing markets must match\nconsumer demand for those products. Due to product price limited purchasing power and cultural differences, our products may not be accepted in any particular emerging or\ndevelopingmarket.\nIf we do not successfully manage the possible negative consequences of our productivity initiatives, our business operations could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that improved productivity is essential to achieving our long-term growth objectives and, therefore, a leading priority of our Company is to design and implement\nthe most effective and efficient business model possible. Consequently, we continuously search for productivity opportunities in our business. Some of the actions we may take\nfrom time to time in pursuing these opportunities may become a distraction for our managers and employees and may disrupt our ongoing business operations; cause\ndeterioration in employee morale which may make it more difficult for us to retain or attract qualified managers and employees; disrupt or weaken the internal control\nstructures of the affected business operations; and give rise to\nnegative publicity which could affect our corporate reputation. If we are unable to successfully manage the possible negative consequences of our productivity initiatives, oun\nbusiness operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to attract or retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce, our business could be negatively affected.\nThe success of our business depends on our Company's and the Coca-Cola system’s ability to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce\nas well as on our success in nurturing a culture that supports our growth and aligns employees around the Company's purpose and work that matters most. Competition and\ncompensation expectations for existing and prospective personnel have increased. In addition, the broader labor market is experiencing a shortage of qualified workers which\nhas further increased the competition we face for qualified employees. We may not be able to successfully compete for, attract or retain the highly skilled and diverse workforce\nthat we want and that our future business needs may require, such as employees with e-commerce, social media and digital marketing and advertising skills, and/or digital and\nanalytics capabilities. Changes in immigration laws and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate highly skilled technical, professional and\nmanagement personnel to meet our business needs. In addition, the unexpected loss of experienced and highly skilled employees due to an increase in aggressive recruiting for\nbest-in-class talent could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness. Failure to atract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled and diverse\ntalent; to meet our goals related to fostering an inclusive and diverse culture, including increasing the number of underrepresented employees in the United States to develop\nand implement an adequate succession plan for our management team; to maintain a corporate culture that fosters innovation, collaboration and inclusion; or to design and\nsuccessfully implement flexible work models that meet the expectations of employees and prospective employees could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business\nand our future success.\nIncreases in the cost, disruption of supply or shortages of energy or fuel could affect our profitability.\nOur consolidated bottling operations operate a large fleet of trucks and other motor vehicles to distribute and deliver\nbeverage products to customers. In addition, we use a significant amount of electricity, natural gas and other energy sources to operate our production plants and the bottling\nplants and distribution facilities operated by our consolidated bottling operations. An increase in the price, disruption of supply or shortage of fuel and other energy sources in\ncountries where we have production plants, or in markets where our consolidated bottling operations operate, which may be caused by increasing demand, by events such as\nnatural disasters, power outages and extreme weather, or by government regulations, taxes, policies or programs designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to address\nclimate change, could increase our operating costs and negatively impact our profitability. Our independent bottling partners also operate large fleets of trucks and other motor\nvehicles to distribute and deliver beverage products to their own customers and use a significant amount of electricity, natural gas and other energy sources to operate their own\nbottling plants and distribution facilities. An increase in the price, disruption of supply or shortage of fuel and other energy sources in any of the major markets in which our\nindependent bottling partners operate could increase the affected independent bottling partners? operating costs and thus could indirectly negatively impact our results of\noperations.\nIncreases in the cost, disruption of supply or shortages of ingredients, other raw materials, packaging materials, aluminum cans and other containers could harm our",

We own or license and market numerous beverage brands, which we group into the following categories: Trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors;\nwater, sports, coffee and tea; juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages. We own and market five of the world's top six nonalcoholic\nsparkling soft drink brands: Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light.\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and\nretailers as well as the Company's consolidated bottling and distribution operations. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for 2.2 billion of the\nestimated 64 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day\nWe believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of beverage options to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles.\nOur success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day.\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells:\n· beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as *beverage bases,” and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our “concentrate\noperations\"); and\n· finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our “finished product operations\").\nGenerally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.\nOur concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which\nwe typically refer as our “bottlers”? or our “bottling partners\"). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the\nproduct), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and\nrefillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through\nwholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the\nUnited States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing\nbeverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations\nare included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment.\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other fnished beverages to retailers, or to distributors and\nwholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our\nBottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to\ndistributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company's bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments\nor our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa. These sales are included in our Global Ventures\noperating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate\nconsumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our\nNorth America operating segment.\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues attributable to concentrate operations and finished product operations:\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total worldwide unit case volume attributable to concentrate operations and finished product operations:\nWe operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. We face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies. We, along\nwith other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic\nconditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, geopolitical conditions, local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations, fuel prices, weather patterns and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn March 8, 2022, the Company announced the suspension of its business in Russia as a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In addition, the conflict has caused\na disruption of our business in Ukraine. The Company will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve. As a point of reference, in 2021, the\nCompany's business in Russia and Ukraine contributed 2 percent of the Company's unit case volume and 1 percent and 2 percent of the Company's consolidated net operating\nrevenues and operating income, respectively.\nThroughout 2022, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resurgence of the virus in certain countries and the related actions by governments to attempt to contain\nthe spread of the virus, continued to negatively impact our business. While uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic remain, and factors such as the state of the supply\nchain, labor shortages and the inflationary environment are likely to impact the pace of the economic recovery, we are focused on executing for growth.\nDespite the dynamic world in which we are currently operating, we believe we are well positioned to create value for our Company and our stakeholders. In an effort to support\nour future growth, we are continuing to invest in our portfolio of brands, our strategic capabilities and our people. We are focused on the following strategic priorities:\nunlocking the potential of our portfolio of strong global, regional and scaled local brands; developing a robust innovation pipeline focusing on scalable initiatives; increasing\nconsumer-centric marketing effectiveness and efficiency; winning in the marketplace with aligned data-driven revenue growth management and execution capabilities; and\nfurther embedding sustainability goals into our operations.",
