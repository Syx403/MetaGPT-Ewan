        "content": "NOTE3:REVENUERECOGNITION\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells:\n· beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as “beverage bases,” and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our “concentrate\noperations\"); and\n· finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our “finished product operations\").\nGenerally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.\nOur concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which\nwe typically refer as our bottlers”? or our bottling partners\"). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the\nproduct), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and\nrefillable and nonrefilable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through\nwholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which\nthey sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain\nsyrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment.\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished beverages to retailers, or to distributors and\nwholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our\nBottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-botling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to\ndistributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company's bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments\nor our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa. These sales are included in our Global Ventures\noperating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate\nconsumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our\nNorth America operating segment.\nRevenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. Our performance obligation generally consists of the\npromise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling partners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers. Control of the concentrates, syrups or finished products is\ntransferred upon shipment to, or receipt at, our customers? locations, as determined by the specific terms of the contract. Upon transfer of control to the customer, which\ncompletes our performance obligation, revenue is recognized. Our sales terms generally do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing\ndefects on our part. After completion of our performance obligation, we have an unconditional right to consideration as outlined in the contract. Our receivables will generally\nbe collected in less than six months, in accordance with the underlying payment terms. All of our performance obligations under the terms of contracts with our customers have\nan original duration of one year or less.\nOur customers and bottling partners may be entitled to cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume-based incentive programs, support for\ninfrastructure programs and other similar programs. In most markets, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned\nfinancial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers always changing neds and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model.\nUnder this model, the price we charge bottlers for concentrates they use to prepare and package finished products is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited\nto, the prices charged by the bottlers for such finished products, the channels in which they are sold, and package mix. The amounts associated with the arrangements described\nabove represent variable consideration, an estimate of which is included in the transaction price as a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statement of\nincome upon completion of our performance obligations. The total revenue recorded, including any variable consideration, cannot exceed the amount for which it is probable\nthat a significant reversal will not occur when uncertainties related to variability are resolved. As a result, we are recognizing revenue based on our faithful depiction of the\nconsideration that we expect to receive. In making our estimates of variable consideration, we consider past results and make significant assumptions related to: (1) customer\nsales volumes; (2) customer ending inventories; (3) customer selling price per unit; (4) selling channels; and (5) discount rates, rebates and other pricing allowances, as\napplicable. In gathering data to estimate our variable consideration, we generally calculate our estimates using a portfolio approach at the country and product line level rather\nthan at the individual contract level. The result of making these estimates will impact the line items trade accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses in our\nconsolidated balance sheet. The actual amounts ultimately paid and/or received may be different from our estimates. The change in the amount of variable consideration\nrecognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 related to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods was immaterial.",

        "content": "ForeignCurrencyRisk\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of\nthe U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to\nadjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with\ncertain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition,\nthe Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its\nforeign currency-denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue\nand inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of\nreasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 26\nTo provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company's foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a\nsensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\"VAR\") model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a\nMonte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair\nvalue, for a given confidence interval, to the Company's foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not\nintended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum\none-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of September 25, 2021, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $551 million as of September 26,\n2020. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset\nby increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company's investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity\nanalyses performed as of September 25, 2021 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates,\nforeign currency exchange rates and the Company's actual exposures and positions.\nApple Inc. | 2021Form 10-K | 27\nIndextoConsolidatedFinancialStatements\nPage\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended September 25. 2021.

        "content": "FinancialRisks\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe Company's profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the\nCompany's products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company's gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure\ndue to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company's ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed\nproduct life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the\nCompany's services; the Company's ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the\ngeographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings;\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These\nand other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company\ngenerates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The\nCompany could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company's products or services, issues with new\nproduct or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company's logistics, components supply,\normanufacturingpartners.\nThe Company's financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.s. dollar relative to local currencies.\nThe Company's primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales, cost of sales and operating\nexpenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company's products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers\ncould be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 15\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and\nearnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company's products. In some circumstances, for\ncompetitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar's strengthening, which would adversely affect\nthe U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency-denominated sales.\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales\nand earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the\nbenefit. Additionaly, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company's cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus\nadverselyaffectinggrossmargins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable\nmovements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company's investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political\nrisk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and\nnon-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents,\nand marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on\nthe Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply\nagreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\nThe Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products\ndirectly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company's outstanding trade\nreceivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company's\ntrade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company's exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade\nreceivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade\nreceivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for\nthe Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of\nSeptember 25, 2021, the Company's vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few\nindividual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade\nreceivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.s. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company's subsidiaries are organized.\nDue to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to\nsignificant change. The Company's effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with difering statutory tax rates, changes in\nthe valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland.\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.s. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and\ngovernmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of\nits provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company's effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in\nthe U.S. or lreland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company's taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company's\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nApple Inc.| 2021Form10-K | 16",

        "content": "1 The increase was primarily related to a change in judgment on certain tax positions due to the Opinion. Refer to Note 1l of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the line item income taxes on our consolidated statement of income. The Company had\n$453 million and $391 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Of these amounts, expense\nof $62 million and $190 million was recognized in 2021 and 2020, respectively. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would\nbe a benefit to the Company's effective tax rate.\nBased on current tax laws, the Company's effective tax rate in 2022 is expected to be approximately 20 percent before considering the potential impact of any significant\noperating and nonoperating items that may affect our effective tax rate.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position\nWe believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of the fundamental strengths of our business. Refer to the heading “Cash Flows from Operating\nActivities” below. The Company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase\nour return on shareowners? equity. Refer to the heading “Cash Flows from Financing Activities\" below. We have a history of borrowing funds both domestically and\ninternationally at reasonable interest rates, and we expect to be able to continue to borrow funds at reasonable rates over the long term. Our debt financing also includes the use\nof a commercial paper program. We currently have the ability to borrow funds in this market at levels that are consistent with our debt financing strategy and expect to continue\nto be able to do so in the future.\nThe Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and, as a result of this review, during 2021 we issued U.S. dollar- and euro-denominated long-\nterm notes of $6.0 billion and E3.2 billion, respectively, across various maturities. We used a portion of the proceeds from these issuances to extinguish certain tranches of our\npreviously issued long-term debt. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these issuances and extinguishments.\nThe Company's cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities totaled $12.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. In addition to these funds, our\ncommercial paper program and our ability to issue long-term debt, we had $8.1 billion in unused backup lines of credit for general corporate purposes as of December 31, 2021.\nThese backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2022 through 2027.\nWhile uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic remain, we expect to continue to see improvements in our business as vaccines become more widely available. The\ntiming and availability of vaccines will be different around the world, and therefore we believe the pace of the recovery will vary by geography depending on vaccine\navailability, rates of vaccination and the effectiveness of vaccines against existing and new variants of the virus, along with other macroeconomic factors. We will remain\nflexible so that we can adjust to uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our current capital allocation priorities are as follows: investing wisely to support our\nbusiness operations, continuing to grow our dividend payment, enhancing our beverage portfolio and capabilities through opportunistic and disciplined acquisitions, and using\nexcess cash to repurchase shares over time. We currently expect 2022 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.5 billion. During 2022, we also expect to repurchase\napproximately $500 million of shares in addition to repurchasing shares equivalent to the proceeds from the issuances of stock under our stock-based compensation plans.\nWe are currently in litigation with the IRS for tax years 2007 through 2009. On November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion in which it predominantly sided with the\nIRS; however, a final decision is still pending and the timing of such decision is not currently known. The Company strongly disagrees with the IRS' positions and the portions\nof the Opinion affrming such positions and intends to vigorously defend our positions uilizing every available avenue of appeal. While the Company believes that i is more\nlikely than not that we will ultimately prevail in this litigation upon appeal, it is possible that all, or some portion of, the adjustments proposed by the IRS and sustained by the\nTax Court could ultimately be upheld. In the event that all of the adjustments proposed by the IRS are ultimately upheld for tax years 2007 through 2009 and the IRS, with the\nconsent of the federal courts, were to decide to apply the Tax Court Methodology to the subsequent years up to and including 2021, the Company currently estimates that the\npotential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $13 billion as of December 31, 2021. Additional income tax and interest would continue to\naccrue until the time any such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. Once the Tax Court renders a final decision, the Company will have 90 days to file a notice\nof appeal and pay the portion of the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which we currently estimate to be\napproximately $4.9 billion (including interest accrued through December 31, 2021), plus any additional interest accrued through the time of payment. Refer to Note 11 of Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the tax litigation.\nWhile we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail in the tax litigation discussed above, we are confident that, between our ability to generate cash flows from\noperating activities and our ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates, we can manage the range of possible outcomes in the final resolution of the matter.\nBased on all of the aforementioned factors, the Company believes its current liquidity position is strong and will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and\ncash commitments for investing and financing activities for the foreseeable future.\nCashFlowsfromOperatingActivities\nAs part of our continued efforts to improve our working capital efficiency, we have worked with our suppliers over the past several years to revisit terms and conditions,\nincluding the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers are 120 days. Additionally, two global financial institutions offer a\nvoluntary supply chain finance (*SCF\") program which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to these\nfinancial institutions on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus may be more beneficial to them. The SCF program is available to suppliers of\ngoods and services included in cost of goods sold as well as suppliers of goods and services included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated\nstatement of income. The Company and our suppliers agree on the contractual terms for the goods and services we procure, including prices, quantities and payment terms,\nregardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the SCF program. The suppliers sell goods or services, as applicable, to the Company and issue the associated invoices\nto the Company based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. Then, if they are participating in the SCF program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which\ninvoices, if any, they want to sell to the financial institutions. Our suppliers? voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms. No\nguarantees are provided by the Company or any of our subsidiaries under the SCF program. We have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate in the SCF\nprogram, and we have ndirect financial relationshp with the financial institutions, asit relates to the CF program.Accordingly,amounts u to our suppliers that elctd t\nparticipate in the SCF program are included in the line itm accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. Allactivity relatd to amounts de to\nsuppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program is reflected within the operating activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. We have been informed\nby the financial institutions that as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, suppliers had elected to sell $882 million and $703 million, respectively, of our outstanding payment\nobligations to the financial institutions. The amounts settled through the SCF program were $3,237 million and $2,810 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and\n2020, respectively. We do not believe there is a risk that our payment terms will be shortened in the near future.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company started a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. Under this program we can elect to sell trade accounts\nreceivables to unaffliated fnancial institutions a a discount. In these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the Company collcts customer payments related t\nthe factored receivables and remits those payments to the financial institutions. The Company sold $6,266 million and $185 million of trade accounts receivables under this\nprogram during the years ended Decmber 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and the costs of factoring such receivables were not material. The cash received from the financial\ninstitutions is classified within the operating activities section in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $12,625 million and $9,844 million, respectively, an increase of $2,781 million,\nor 28 percent. This increase was primarily driven by increased operating income, which includes a benefit from our trade accounts receivable factoring program, a favorable\nimpact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, lower annual incentive payments in 2021 as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operating\nperformance in 2020, lower payments in 2021 of prior year-end marketing accruals due to lower spending in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and lower\nprepayments to customers in 2021. These items were partially ofset by higher payments related to our strategic realignment initiatives along with higher tax payments in 2021.\nCashFlowsfromInvestingActivities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2,765 million and $1,477 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nPurchases of Investments and Proceeds fromDisposals of Investments\nIn 2021, purchases of investments were $6,030 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $7,059 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $1,029 million. In\n2020, purchases of investments were $13,583 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $13,835 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $252 million. This\nactivity primarily represents the purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments in marketable securities and short-term investments that were made as part of the\nCompany's overall cash management strategy. Also included in this activity are purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments held by our captive insurance\ncompanies.\nAcquisitions of Businesses,EquityMethod Investments and NonmarketableSecurities\nIn 2021, the Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $4,766 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of\nthe remaining ownership interest in BodyArmor.\nIn 2020, the Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $1,052 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of\nthe remaining ownership interest in fairlife.\nRefer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions.\nProceeds fromDisposals ofBusinesses,Equity Method Investments and NonmarketableSecurities\nIn 2021, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities were $2,180 million, which primarily related to the sale of our\nownership interest in CCA, an equity method investee, to CCEP, also an equity method investee.\nIn 2020, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities were $189 million, which primarily related to the sale of our\nownership interest in Piedmont Coca-Cola Bottling Partnership to Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., an equity method investee.\nRefer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our disposals.\nPurchasesofProperty,PlantandEquipment\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $1,367 million and $1,177 million, respectively\nTotal capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and the percentage of such totals by operating segment and Corporate were as follows (in millions):\nCashFlowsfromFinancingActivities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $6,786 million and $8,070 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively\nDebt Financing\nOur Company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our\noverall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners? equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our\ncredit ratings.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our long-term debt was rated “A+\" by Standard & Poor's and “A1\" by Moody's. Our commercial paper program was rated “A-1\" by Standard &\nPoor's and *p-1 by Moody's. In assessing our credit strength, both rating agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and\nfinancial policies as well as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, certain rating agencies also consider the financial\ninformation of certain bottlers, including CCEP, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation for the\ndebt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company's business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep\nthese bottlers viable. It is our expectation that these rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in\nour capital structure, our major bottlers? financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our\ncost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers credit ratings were to decline, the Company's equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential\nincrease in interest expense for those bottlers.\nWe monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different\naggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our\nCompany.\nOur global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to borrow funds at a low effective cost. This posture,\ncoupled with active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt as well as our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of\nborrowing. Our debt management policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase program and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets.\nIssuances and payments of debt included both short-term and long-term financing activities. During 2021, the Company had issuances of debt of $13,094 million, which\nincluded $3,391 million of issuances related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and $80 million of net issuances related to\ncommercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less. The Company's total long-term debt issuances were $9,623 million, net of related discounts and\nissuancecosts.\nDuring 2021, the Company made payments of debt of $12,866 million, which consisted of $2,357 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with\nmaturities greater than 90 days and payments of long-term debt of $10,509 million.\nDuring 2020, the Company had issuances of debt of $26,934 million, which included $8,260 million of issuances related to commercial paper and short-term debt with\nmaturities greater than 90 days and long-term debt issuances of $18,674 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs.\nDuring 2020, the Company made payments of debt of $28,796 million, which included $15,292 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with\nmaturities greater than 90 days and $1,768 million net issuances related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less. The Company's total\npayments of long-term debt were $11,736 million.\nOn December 31, 2021, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, the governing body responsible for regulating LIBOR, ceased to publish certain LIBOR reference\nrates. However, other LIBOR reference rates, including U.S. dollar overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month maturities will continue to be published through June\n2023. In preparation for the discontinuation of LIBOR, wehave amended, or willamend, our LOR-referencing agreements to either reference the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate or include mechanics for selecting an alternative rate. We do not plan to enter into variable-rate agreements that reference LIOR after Decmber 31, 2021.\nIssuancesofStock\nThe issuances of stock in 2021 and 2020 were related to the exercise of stock options by Company employees.\nShareRepurchases\nIn 2012, the Board ofDirectors authorized a share repurchase plan ofup to 500 millon shares of the Company's common stock. In 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a\nnew plan for the Company to purchase up to an additional 150 million shares of our common stock\nDuring 2021 and 2020, the Company did not repurchase common stock under the share repurchase plan authorized by our Board of Directors. Since the inception of our share\nrepurchase program in 1984, we have purchased 3.5 billion shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $17.25. In addition to shares repurchased under the\nshare repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors, the Company's treasury stock activity also includes shares surrendered to the Company to pay the exercise\nprice and/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so-called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and/or the vesting of restricted stock issued to\nemployees. The Company's treasury stock activity during 2021 resulted in a cash outflow of $111 million.\nDividends\nThe Company paid dividends of $7,252 million and $7,047 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAt its February 2022 meeting, our Board of Directors increased our regular quarterly dividend to $0.44 per share, equivalent to a full year dividend of $1.76 per share in 2022.\nThis is our 60th consecutive annual increase. Our annualized common stock dividend was $1.68 per share and $1.64 per share in 2021 and 2020, respectively.",

Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion regarding the Company's 2015 litigation with the IRS involving transfer pricing tax adjustments in which the court\npredominantly sided with the IRS. The Company disagrees with the Opinion and intends to vigorously defend its position. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $926 million. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would\nbe a benefit of $617 million, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties. The remaining $309 million primarily represents tax benefits that would be received in\ndifferent tax jurisdictions in the event the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions.\nA reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the line item income taxes in our consolidated statement of income. The Company had\n$496 million and $453 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of these amounts, expense\nof $43 million and $62million was recognized in 2022 and 2021, respectively. If the Company were to prevail on alluncertain tax positions, the reversal of this acrual woud\nbe a benefit to the Company's effective tax rate.\nBased on current tax laws, the Company's effective tax rate in 2023 is expected to be approximately 19.5 percent before considering the potential impact of any significant\noperating and nonoperating items that may affect our effective tax rate.\nLIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND FINANCIAL POSITION\nWe believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of the fundamental strengths of our business. Refer to the heading “Cash Flows from Operating\nActivities\" below. The Company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase\nour return on shareowners? equity. Refer to the heading “Cash Flows from Financing Activities\"? below. We have a history of borrowing funds both domestically and\ninternationally at reasonable interest rates, and we expect to be able to continue to borrow funds at reasonable rates over the long term. Our debt financing also includes the use\nof a commercial paper program. We currently have the ability to borrow funds in this market at levels that are consistent with our debt financing strategy, and we expect to\ncontinue to be able to do so in the future. The Company regularly reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt.\nThe Company's cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities totaled $11.6 billion as of December 31, 2022. In addition to these funds, our\ncommercial paper program and our ability to issue long-term debt, we had $4.4 billion in unused backup lines of credit for general corporate purposes as of December 31, 2022.\nThese backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2023 through 2028.\nOur current capital allocation priorities are as follows: investing wisely to support our business operations, continuing to grow our dividend payment, enhancing our beverage\nportfolio and capabilities through consumer-centric acquisitions, and using excess cash to repurchase shares over time. We currently expect 2023 capital expenditures to be\napproximately $1.9 billion. During 2023, we also expect to repurchase shares to offset dilution resulting from employee stock-based compensation plans.\nWe are currently in litigation with the IRS for tax years 2007 through 2009. On November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion in which it predominantly sided with the\nIRS; however, a final decision is still pending and the timing of such decision is not currently known. The Company strongly disagrees with the IRS' positions and the portions\nof the Opinion affrming such positions and intends to vigorously defend our positions utilizing every available avenue of appeal. While the Company believes that it is more\nlikely than not that we will ultimately prevail in this litigation upon appeal, it is possible that all, or some portion of, the adjustments proposed by the IRS and sustained by the\nTax Court could ultimately be upheld. In the event that all of the adjustments proposed by the IRS were ultimately upheld for tax years 2007 through 2009 and the IRS, with the\nconsent of the federal courts, were to decide to apply the Tax Court Methodology to the subsequent years up to and including 2022, the Company currently estimates that the\npotential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $14 billion as of December 31, 2022. Additional income tax and interest would continue to\naccrue until the time any such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. Once the Tax Court renders a final decision, the Company will have 90 days to file a notice\nof appeal and pay the portion of the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which we currently estimate to be\napproximately $5.2 billion (including interest accrued through December 31, 2022), plus any additional interest accrued through the time of payment. Refer to Note 11 of Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the tax litigation.\nWhile we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail in the tax litigation discussed above, we are confident that, between our ability to generate cash flows from\noperating activities and our ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates, we can manage the range of possible outcomes in the final resolution of the matter.\nBased on all of the aforementioned factors, the Company believes its current liquidity position is strong and will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and\ncash commitments for investing and financing activities for the foreseeable future.\nCashFlowsfromOperatingActivities\nAs part of our continued efforts to improve our working capital efficiency, we have worked with our suppliers over the past several years to revisit terms and conditions,\nincluding the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers are 120 days. Additionally, two global financial institutions offer a\nvoluntary supply chain finance (SCF\") program which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to selltheir receivables from the Company to these financial institutions\non a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus may be more beneficial to them. The SCF program is available to suppliers of goods and services\nincluded in cost of goods sold as well as suppliers of goods and services included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. The\nCompany and our suppliers agree on contractual terms for the goods and services we procure,including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier\nelects to participate in the SCF program. The suppliers sell goods or services, as applicable, to the Company and issue the associated invoices to the Company based on the\nagreed-upon contractual terms. Then, if they are participating in the SCF program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which invoices, if any, they want to sell to\nthe financial institutions. Our suppliers′ voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms. No guarantees are provided by the Company\nor any of our subsidiaries under the SCF program. We have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate in the SCF program, and we have no direct financial\nrelationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to the SCF program. Accordingly, amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program are\nincluded in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. All activity related to amounts due to suppliers that elected to participate in\nthe SCF program is reflected within the operating activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. We have been informed by the financial institutions that as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, suppliers had elected to sell $1,234 million and $882 million, respectively, of our outstanding payment obligations to the financial institutions.\nThe amounts settled through the SCF program were $4,724 million and $3,237 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We do not believe\nthere is a risk that our payment terms will be shortened in the near future.\nThe Company has a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. Under this program, we can elect to sell trade accounts receivables to unaffiliated financial\ninstitutions at a discount. In these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the Company collects customer payments related to the factored receivables and remits\nthose payments to the financial institutions. The Company sold $10,709 million and $6,266 million of trade accounts receivables under this program during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The costs of factoring such receivables were $27 million and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. The cash received from the financial institutions is classified within the operating activities section in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $11,018 million and $12,625 million, respectively, a decrease of $1,607 million,\nor 13 percent. This decrease was primarily driven by higher marketing payments resulting from 2021 year-end accruals, an unfavorable impact due to foreign currency\nexchange rate fluctuations, the buildup of inventory to manage potential supply chain disruptions, and higher annual incentive and tax payments in 2022. These items were\npartially offset by increased operating income, lower payments related to our strategic realignment initiatives, and increased benefits from the extension of certain vendor\npayment terms and our trade accounts receivable factoring program.\nCashFlowsfromInvestingActivities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $763 million and $2,765 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nPurchases of Investments andProceedsfromDisposals of Investments\nIn 2022, purchases of investments were $3,751 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $4,771 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $1,020 million. In\n2021, purchases of investments were $6,030 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $7,059 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $1,029 million. This\nactivity primarily represents the purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments in marketable securities and short-term investments that were made as part of the\nCompany's overall cash management strategy. Also included in this activity are purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments held by our captive insurance\ncompanies.\nAcquisitions ofBusinesses,EquityMethod Investments andNonmarketableSecurities\nIn 2022, the Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $73 million.\nIn 2021, the Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $4,766 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of\nthe remaining ownership interest in BodyArmor.\nRefer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions.\nProceeds from Disposals of Businesses,Equity Method Investments andNonmarketableSecurities\nIn 2022, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $458 million, which primarily related to the refranchising of\nour bottling operations in Cambodia and the sale of our ownership interest in one of our equity method investments.\nIn 2021, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $2,180 million, which primarily related to the sale of our\nownership interest in CCA, an equity method investe, to CCEP, also an equity method investe.\nRefer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our disposals.\nPurchasesofProperty,Plant andEquipment\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $1,484 million and $1,367 million, respectively.\nCollateral paid associated with our hedging activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 was $1,465 million. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements for additional information on our hedging activities.\nOtherInvestingActivities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total cash inflow for other investing activities was $706 million and $51 million, respectively. The activities during\n2022 included cash proceeds of $823 million received in advance of the refranchising of our bottling operations in Vietnam. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements for additional information on this transaction.\nCashFlowsfromFinancingActivities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $10,250 million and $6,786 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nDebt Financing\nOur Company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our\noverall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners? equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our\ncredit ratings.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our long-term debt was rated “A+”\" by Standard & Poor's and “A1\" by Moody's. Our commercial paper program was rated “A-1”\" by Standard &\nPoor's and “P-1”\" by Moody's. In assessing our credit strength, both rating agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and\nfinancial policies as well as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, certain rating agencies also consider the financial\ninformation of certain bottlers, including CCEP, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation for the\ndebt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company's business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep\nthese bottlers viable. It is our expectation that these rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in\nour capital structure, our major bottlers^ financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies? methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our\ncost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers credit ratings were to decline, the Company's equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential\nincreaseininterest expensefor thosebottlers.\nWe monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different\naggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our\nCompany.\nOur global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to borrow funds at a low effective cost. This posture,\ncoupled with active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt as well as our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of\nborrowing. Our debt management policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase program and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets.\nIssuances and payments of debt included both short-term and long-term financing activities. During 2022, the Company had issuances of debt of $3,972 million, which\nincluded $2,321 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days, $798 million of net issuances of commercial paper and\nshort-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less, and long-term debt issuances of $853 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs.\nDuring 2022, the Company made payments of debt of $4,930 million, which consisted of $3,623 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with\nmaturities greater than 90 days and payments of long-term debt of $1,307 million.\nDuring 2021, the Company had issuances of debt of $13,094 million, which included $3,391 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities\ngreater than 90 days, $80 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less and long-term debt issuances of $9,623 million,\nnet of related discounts and issuance costs.\nDuring 2021, the Company made payments of debt of $12,866 million, which consisted of $2,357 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with\nmaturities greater than 90 days and payments of long-term debt of $10,509 million.\nOn December 31, 2021, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, the governing body responsible for regulating LIBOR, ceased to publish certain LIBOR reference\nrates. However, other LIBOR reference rates, including U.S. dollar overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month maturities, will continue to be published through June\n2023. In preparation for the discontinuation of LIBOR, we have amended, or will amend, our LIBOR-referencing agreements to either reference the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate or include mechanics for selecting an alternative rate. We do not plan to enter into variable-rate agreements that reference LIBOR in the future.\nIssuancesofStock\nThe issuances of stock in 2022 and 2021 were related to the exercise of stock options by employees.\nShareRepurchases\nIn 2012, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan of up to 500 million shares (*2012 Plan\") of the Company's common stock. In May 2022, the Company\nreached the maximum number of shares that could be repurchased under the 2012 Plan and thereby completed the plan. In 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a new share\nrepurchase plan of up to 150 million shares of the Company's common stock.\nDuring 2022, the total cash outflow for treasury stock purchases was $1,418 million. The Company repurchased 21.3 million shares of common stock under the share\nrepurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors. These shares were repurchased at an average price per share of $62.67, for a total cost of $1,336 million. Since the\ninception of our share repurchase program in 1984, we have repurchased 3.5 billion shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $17.53. In addition to shares\nrepurchased under the share repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors, the Company's treasury stock activity also includes shares surrendered to the Company to\npay the exercise price and/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so-called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and/or the vesting of restricted\nstock issued to employees. The net impact of the Company's issuances of stock and share repurchases during 2022 resulted in a net cash outflow of $581 million.\nDuring 2021, the Company did not repurchase shares of our common stock under the share repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors.\nDividends\nThe Company paid dividends of $7,616 million and $7,252 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAt its February 2023 meeting, our Board of Directors increased our regular quarterly dividend to $0.46 per share, equivalent to a full year dividend of $1.84 per share in 20231\nThis is our 61st consecutive annual increase. Our annualized common stock dividend was $1.76 per share and $1.68 per share in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOtherFinancingActivities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total cash outflow for other financing activities was $1,095 million and $353 million, respectively. The activities\nduring 2022 included payments totaling $637 million related to the BodyArmor acquisition, which included amounts originally held back for indemnification obligations.\nAdditionally, other financing activities during 2022 and 2021 included repayments of collateral related to our hedging programs.\n55\nRefer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding loans and notes payable. Upon payment of outstanding commercial paper, we typically issue\nnew commercial paper. Lines of credit and other short-term borrowings are expected to fluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs, especially at international subsidiaries.",

        "content": "MacroeconomicandIndustryRisks\nThe Company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can\nmaterially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales. In addition, the Company's\nglobal supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company's supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the\nU.S. As a result, the Company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and\nmonetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations can materially adversely affect demand for the Company's\nproducts and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial\nnews, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare\ncosts andother economicfactors.\nApple Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K | 6\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company's products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a\nsignificant impact on the Company's suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\nPotential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company's products; and insolvency.\nA downturn in the economic environment can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company's trade receivables; the failure of derivative\ncounterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company's ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the\nCompany's financial instruments. These and other economic factors can materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nThe Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health\nissues,industrial accidentsandotherbusinessinterruptions.\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business\ninterruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers,\nsuppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\nThe Company has a large, global business, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Trade and other international\ndisputes can result in tariffs, sanctions, and other measures that restrict international trade and can adversely affect the Company's business. For example,\ntensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business\nrestrictions. Tarifs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs\nadversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which\ncould make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or\nexports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its\nproducts and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business\nrelationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade\nrestrictions can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company's operations and distracting to management. Such restrictions can be announced with\nlitle or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding\ntrade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's\nbusiness.\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations\nthat are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power\nshortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks,\nlabor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COViD-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate\nchange is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for\nthe Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and\nresult in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery\ntime, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the\nsupply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the\nCompany.\nThe Company's operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company's suppliers are\nrequired to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company's business and\nharm to the Company's reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COviD-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the\nfuture adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety\nmeasures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in\nthe Company's supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of\nnewproducts.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 7\nGlobal markets for the Company's products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be",

The CoviD-19\npandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COviD-19\npandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company's business, results of\noperations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company's stock.\nDuring 2021, aspects of the Company's business continued to be affected by the COviD-19 pandemic, with many of the Company's retail stores, as well as\nchannel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and a significant number of the Company's employees working remotely. The Company has\nreopened all of its retail stores and substantially all of its other facilities, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of\nemployees and customers, and it continues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its facilities, subject to local rules and regulations. During the fourth\nquarter of 2021, certain of the Company's component suppliers and logistical service providers experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that\naffected sales worldwide. Similar disruptions could occur in the future.\nThe extent of the continuing impact of the COvID-19 pandemic on the Company's operational and financial performance is uncertain and will depend on many\nfactors outside the Company's control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development,\navailability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the\nglobal economy and demand for consumer products.

        "content": "risk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost\nexceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company\nreviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers' facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances\nindicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which\nthe carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and\npurchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges\ngiven the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase\nobligations cover the Company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company's markets\nare volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or\ninsufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or\natall.\nThe Company's products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In\naddition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent\ncoverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company's products and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property\nrights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.\nBased on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially\nreasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the\nright to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling\ncertain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company's future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and\nservices. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company's\nproducts. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company's products, customers may choose not to buy\ntheCompany's products.\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers' perception and\nanalysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company's products compared to competitors'\nplatforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming\nplatforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated,\nexpected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 10\nThe Company's minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade\nsoftware for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors' products with larger\nmarket share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company's devices can\nSuffer.\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company's products\nand operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of\nchange, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can result in\ndissatisfiedcustomers.\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue\nthey generate on the App Store. The Company only retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods within an application.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and legal conditions. The\nCompany may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the proposed European Union (\"EU\") Digital Markets Act, could,\nif enacted, require further changes. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the\nCompany's business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges\ndevelopers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission\nthat the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise\nnarrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company's customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable\nterms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party\ncontent, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company's own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content\ncan be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all\nSome third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult\nor impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company's\naccess to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices\nwith acceptableusagerules.\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and\nsubscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company's customers. The COviD-19 pandemic has also caused additional restrictions on production and increased\ncosts for digital content.\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the\nCompany may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license\nsuch solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.\nThe Company's success depends largely on the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel.\nMuch of the Company's future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team\nand other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially\nin Silicon Valley, where most of the Company's key personnel are located. The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of\nits success. If the Company is unable to nurture and maintain its culture, it could adversely affect the Company's ability to recruit and retain highly skilled\nemployees and materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\nThe Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing\nmanufacturers. The Company also sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized\nbusinesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company's products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users' purchases of the\ndevice. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 11\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers' stores with Company\nemployees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or\nincremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company's products, or uncertainty\nregarding demand for some or all of the Company's products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's products.\nThe Company's business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.\nThe Company and its global supply chain are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents,\npower disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity\nincidents, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company's or its vendors'\nbusiness continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company's\nbusiness by, among other things, preventing access to the Company's online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and\nshipping of the Company's products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant\nreputational,financial,legal andoperationalconsequences.\nThe Company's business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company's customers and\nemployees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures\nintended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential\ninformation occur and could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company's business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are\nalso exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential\ninformation that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company's behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or\nunauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company's\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to\ncompromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and could, among other things, impair\nthe Company's ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the price of the Company's stock, materially damage commercial\nrelationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company.\nGlobally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are\ndesigned to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company's ability to identify, investigate\nand recover from incidents.\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various\nindustries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns,\nmanages, stores and processes.\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of\nsensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies,\nthese security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system\nerror, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company's or its vendors' employees or\ncustomers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company's or its\nvendors' systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor\nauthentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can\nresult in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company's products and services.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient\nto cover all losses or alltypes of claims that may arise.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 12\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company's ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated\nand adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and\nuncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and\nregulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and\nintangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory\napprovals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise\nlimit the Company's ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The\nfailure of any significant investment could adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company's retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to",
