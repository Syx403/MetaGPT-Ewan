## Expert Evidence Analysis

**Indicator Tension Analysis:**
The RSI(14) at 56.15 indicates neutral momentum, neither overbought nor oversold, aligning with the price's position near the middle Bollinger Band of $58.09. This alignment suggests a balanced momentum environment. The multi-period trend structure, with the price above all moving averages, supports this neutral to slightly bullish momentum, indicating no significant tension between momentum indicators and trend structure.

**Dead Cat vs Value Entry:**
The price's proximity to the SMA(20) and its position above both the SMA(50) and SMA(200) suggest a 'Value Entry Opportunity.' The alignment of the price with key moving averages and the absence of significant deviations indicate structural support, reducing the likelihood of a dead cat bounce scenario.
