  "market_regime": "The current price of $58.12 is slightly above the short-term SMA(20) of $58.09, indicating a marginally positive short-term trend. In the medium-term, the price is +3.62% above the SMA(50) of $56.09, suggesting a more pronounced upward trend. Over the long-term, the price is +4.09% above the SMA(200) of $55.84, reinforcing a sustained upward trend. The relatively small deviations from the moving averages across all timeframes suggest a stable market regime with limited mean reversion risk, as the price remains close to structural support levels.",
  "indicator_tension_analysis": "The RSI(14) at 56.15 indicates neutral momentum, neither overbought nor oversold, aligning with the price's position near the middle Bollinger Band of $58.09. This alignment suggests a balanced momentum environment. The multi-period trend structure, with the price above all moving averages, supports this neutral to slightly bullish momentum, indicating no significant tension between momentum indicators and trend structure.",
  "dead_cat_vs_value": "The price's proximity to the SMA(20) and its position above both the SMA(50) and SMA(200) suggest a 'Value Entry Opportunity.' The alignment of the price with key moving averages and the absence of significant deviations indicate structural support, reducing the likelihood of a dead cat bounce scenario.",
